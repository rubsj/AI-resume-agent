# 🧠 AI Resume Agent – Core Project Plan

## 🎯 Objective

Build a high-performance AI-powered system that:

- Parses resumes from various formats (PDF/DOCX)
- Matches candidates to job descriptions (JDs)
- Scores relevance and quality
- Offers feedback or optimization suggestions
- Optionally integrates with ATS systems or job boards

---

## 📁 Modules Breakdown

### 1. Resume Ingestion & Parsing

- Support file upload (PDF, DOCX)
- Extract structured data: education, roles, skills, etc.
- Generate vector embeddings for semantic search/matching

### 2. Job Description (JD) Matching

- Parse JDs to extract requirements and key terms
- Semantic similarity with resume vectors
- Penalize gaps (missing critical skills, outdated experience)

### 3. Scoring Engine

- Match score (0–100)
- Rule-based baseline + LLM-enhanced matching
- Weighted components: skills, recency, education, formatting

### 4. Resume Feedback Generator

- Improve content clarity, formatting, and keyword alignment
- Feedback tone: constructive, clear, professional
- Output format: inline annotations or bullet-point suggestions

### 5. UI/UX Flow

- Upload → See score → Get feedback
- Optional re-upload after revision
- Export optimized version or ATS-friendly format

### 6. Infrastructure & Deployment

- API layer (FastAPI, Vercel, or Fly.io)
- LangChain or custom LLM routing
- Caching layer (e.g. Redis or Supabase for history)

### 7. Privacy & Compliance

- Anonymize PII in resume data
- Define data retention and deletion policy
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and AI transparency principles
