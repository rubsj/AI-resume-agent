Designed, tested and implemented a pneumatic circuit to insure proper conditions existed prior to engaging and dis-engaging the clutch on the Frac pump units. This circuit was also used to monitor the temperature of the hydraulic oil in the reservoir and shut down the system if the temperature exceeded a certain level. Additionally, I was responsible for designing and implementing a new hydraulic system for the company's drilling rigs. This system was designed to reduce the amount of downtime caused by hydraulic leaks and to improve the overall efficiency of the rigs. The system was successfully implemented and has been in use for over a year with no reported issues."

The Mission: To work with a team as designer or in some capacity where my creativity and thinking outside the box can be utilized best. To provide graphic expressions that convey the best message whether it be print or web presentation. My many years of experience affords me depth of knowledge in the arts fields, hands on, and I intend to use this knowledge for future endeavors as freelance designer. My Offerings: I focus on using my creative energy and experience as a Graphic Artist skilled in a variety of designs, logos and marketing packages designed to strengthen business competence. I am a visual designer with an aptitude for experimental projects. My design skills are unique - I utilize the basic elements of design: color, line, shape, space, texture and value to help with the overall creation of any art projects or instruction. My training, experience, and education in art enables me to have a vast resource of ideas to share. And very importantly, other's ideas inspire me to go beyond and create things that clients envisioned."
