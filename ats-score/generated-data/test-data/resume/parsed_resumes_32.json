I feel that I am a great candidate to be employed in technical role due my education and experience with ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo. Course work for my degree included instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend. Instrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in relation to one another. Engineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness. I was able to use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the OEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which required my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience through the Project Engineer & Maintenance\/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions. The Project Engineer role required me to have excellent verbal and written communication skills. While holding this position I worked extensively with all departments within the facility on their requests to improve safety, quality & efficiencies. I was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders & vendors\/ integrators. This role required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain. I currently hold the position of Maintenance\/Engineering Business Unit Leader.  This role includes maintaining & improving line OEE and doing so within the limitation of a parts, labor and capital budget. My team and I review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule.  I am responsible for developing the skills of 34 mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis. Also, I am responsible for training mechanics to ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal\/State Regulatory Laws. Frito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs. My college career at MTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience.

Client:  Intel USA\nI am currently being trained in Genesys tool and 10nm Intel flow.  I am working on blocks like LDO to begin with.  Client:  Qualcomm Pvt Ltd India\n WTR-RX\/TX SYNTH in 14FF (Samsung foundry) : Duration of project - 6 months\nI managed a team of 6 who worked on WTR synth project done in 14FF Samsung foundry.  This is one of the most challenging tasks in my career, as this is the first RF task that I have worked in FF technologies.  To overcome the challenges I have undergone various FinFet related trainings to understand the process and its impact on layout.        Experience      Engineering Project Manager  ,   12\/2012   to   06\/2017    Company Name          I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.  I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.  These sheets certainly helped us to plan the next project much better.  WTR-RX\/TX SYNTH in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 6 months\nI lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.  My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables.  I also handled some portion of the TOP level layout tasks.  I worked on blocks like HFVCO, Regulator, VCO Buffer and LPF during this project.  I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.  I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.  WTR QLNA Daisy Chain 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months\nFor this particular project I had regular discussions with the Packaging team to create the best Daisy Chain structures for a WLP CHIP which I had work on previously.  I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.  WTR QLNA Metal Variants Tapeout 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months\nWe needed metal variants for the QLNA chip which I previously worked on.  In design we leave scope for meal options which can be used to study certain features better during testing.  Here I worked on creating four chips with different metal variant options.  I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.  WTR QLNA in 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 5 months\nThis was my first project in 180nm TSMC process.  In this project I mentored one other junior in my team who worked on MBIAS block while I worked in creating the LNA.  WTR RX BBF in 28nm (TSMC\/UMC) : Duration of project - 4 months\nI lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.  My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables using Gantt chart and XL sheet.  I worked on the top level and few sub-blocks of BBF in this project.  WTR FBRX in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 4 months\nThis task was about working on FBRX module which was previously done.  There we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications.  My role in this task was to identify the IQ imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them.  I was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done.  WTR Low Band Low Noise Amplifier 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 3 months\nThis is a Low Band LNA which operates between 860 - 900 Mhz frequencies.  Here layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout.  Majorly the input devices to which RF_IN signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry.  WTR Mixer, Attenuator in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 10 months\nThis is the first project which I worked on in RF domain and I had a wonderful experience working on this project.  The blocks that I worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project.  The blocks were ready on time with good quality.
