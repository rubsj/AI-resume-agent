{"ID":13199813,"Category":"BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT","Resume_str":"         DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT       Executive Profile    My goal is to use my unique collection of expertise,\nexperience, and skills gained from my seventeen years as a construction\nbusiness development and marketing representative, five years managing a sales\nforce, six years helping my father run his historic home remodeling business, and\nmy college education to reach my full potential as an account executive by\nhelping Visio Financial Services achieve steady, long-term, sustainable growth\nby building productive relationships with customers, co-workers, company\nleadership, and other stakeholders.      Core Accomplishments       Sales and Marketing     Increased income 112% in 12 months in Austin  Increased market share from 20% to 70% in downtown Atlanta construction market in 12 months  Designed and executed branding plan to change the image of the organization, resulting in significant market share increase in each of 23 major U.S. cities  Investigated markets and target customer issues to create messaging strategy     Market Research     Defined industry segments and identified opportunities in 23 major U.S. cities  Discovered new opportunities in mature markets and developed and led the implementation of  plans to capture significant market share     Account Management     Managed various sized accounts and grew business by providing superb customer service  Successfully grew account sizes in 23 major U.S. markets  Trained local staff to continue the example of growing accounts through excellent client service        Professional Experience      Director of Business Development   04\/2005   to   04\/2015     Company Name   City  ,   State      Washington, DC I was called upon to develop and implement growth initiatives in the most difficult scenarios. Whether in low market share environments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned. Through my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga, Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno.   Following is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments:     Miami  - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17 building owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building managers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization.    Minneapolis   - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market.     Austin   - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas.     Denver   - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a \"pitchy, preachy\" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.          Director of Business Development\/Political Relations Director   01\/1998   to   01\/2005     Company Name    North Carlolina, South Carolina, Georgia After only three months as a field representative in Augusta, Georgia, I was promoted to Director of Business Development covering North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Shortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states. During my tenure, I focused primarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in the three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone. Following is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed shareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO's and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca-Cola, Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power. Leveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to provide even more bid opportunities. As Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley Franklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in the South. I also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta political powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.  Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful campaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.        Business Manager\/Account Executive   01\/1995   to   01\/1998     Company Name     State     I served as an apprentice under my father until I graduated high school, and a house we rebuilt on Tradd Street in Charleston, South Carolina, was voted house of the decade in the 1980's by the Preservation Society of Charleston.
