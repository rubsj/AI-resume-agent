Skills Used Business, design & sales skills   This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.  The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.        06\/1991   to   09\/1994     Owner\/Manager      Company Name   –   City  ,   State    Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.

Transitional Vocation    In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.  I was owner of income properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.  Within six months, all units were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.    In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment complex.  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I heard while marketing existing floor plans.  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a long waiting list.  Approximately 1\/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely gratifying.  I continued in this position to the end of construction.  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a Residential Property Management Certificate.  My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design.        Education     1970     Associate of Arts  :   architectural\/interior design     New York School of Interior Design   -   City  ,   State      Architecture and interior design history   Fine arts history   Color theory and application   Light theory and application   Textiles  Upholstery  Window treatments  Paint, surface textures, wallcoverings  Interior building materials  Architectural drawing and perspective rendering  Business and marketing principles for designers    All courses were taught by professionals in their respective fields with years of practical experience.         1967     Associate of Arts  :   business principles and skills     Lansing Business University (Davenport Business College)   -   City  ,   State      Basic business management principles  Business law  Office management    Accounting\/bookkeeping  Office skills (typing, shorthand, business machines, etc.)  Business etiquette           Skills    Accounting, advertising, Basic, business law, business writing, computer aided design, Color, com, client, clients, drafting, Edit, email, Interior Design, marketing, Materials, window, rendering, retail, sales skills, sales, shorthand, space-planning, specification, phone, typing   "}
