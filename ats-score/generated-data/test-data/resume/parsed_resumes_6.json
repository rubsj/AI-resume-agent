Projects:     Atlas:        Description:    This project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions. There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler. A tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he\/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor submits availability. A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. Also, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task which runs every day.   Responsibilities:     Created a Availability Calendar Grid. In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. Clicking on the cell toggles the availability. Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data)  Developed C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.  Got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. Created Class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.

Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding standards of the overall application.  Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS: Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0\/3.5\/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio 2008\/2010\/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005\/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1) LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.

Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper. We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.    "}
