My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event was something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner.

My first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues. I was able to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers.
