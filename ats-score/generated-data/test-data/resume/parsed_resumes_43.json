Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.  This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.  It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.  Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.  Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.
