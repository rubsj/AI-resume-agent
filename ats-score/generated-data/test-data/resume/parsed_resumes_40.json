Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.  This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.  Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to poor performance.  Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
