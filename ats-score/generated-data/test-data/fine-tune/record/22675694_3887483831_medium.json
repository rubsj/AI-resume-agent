believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner.\nMy design was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that I believe helped me learn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information while doing something I enjoy.\nCashier/Waiter/Greeter\nMarch 2013\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nA volunteering experience that I took part in was a Dog Fair back in 2013, it was an opportunity for people to come into the fair and find dogs that they wanted to adopt and also a chance for dog owners to come in with their dogs and participate in Dog races, raffles, and purchase many other dog related things in support of the Dog adoption agency to care for the other dogs that had currently not been adopted yet.\nMy first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles.\nAs the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food.\nI up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs.\nI took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues.\nI was able to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers.\nI rotated around, taking on the responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.\nWork History\nAnimal Caretaker\nJune
