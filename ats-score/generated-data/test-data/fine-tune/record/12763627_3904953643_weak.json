AT WORK: 1) LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney.\nIt is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units.\nThe primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor).\nIt is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.\nUBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC.\nThe typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc.\nDEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending).\nUser can login to the system and can review the exception records.\nAnd also user can rectify the exceptions to

parties (Company and Client) before they start the work.\nThis process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement.\nThe existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc.\nThe new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events.\nApart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into
