Your role will be critical in bridging the gap between the conceptual architecture and the actual implementation of technology solutions. In this unique position, you will spend approximately 60% of your time on hands-on implementation activities, such as system configuration, cloud deployment, and integration tasks. You'll work closely with clients to understand their business requirements, constraints, and current technological landscape. Leveraging this understanding, you will architect solutions that not only meet but exceed client expectations, considering scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. Given the heavier implementation focus, you'll often find yourself transitioning seamlessly from a design meeting to configuring network protocols, setting up cloud-based services, or troubleshooting deployed solutions. Your deep technical expertise, along with your exceptional communication skills, will enable you to articulate the benefits and nuances of your architectural decisions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. As a valuable member of our team, you will not only contribute to the successful delivery of solutions but also play a key role in mentoring junior staff and leading by example.
