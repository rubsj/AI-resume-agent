Then, Alan Stillman opened Fridays as a way, he said, “to meet Pan Am stewardesses.” Suddenly, there was a place with great food, new and exciting drinks and an electric energy. A place where bartenders mixed the environment just as well as they mixed drinks. In short, a place like nowhere else.\n\nToday, Fridays in Bedford Park, IL is still America’s most iconic bar and grill. We embrace and celebrate our heritage as a bar. One that just happens to serve killer food in an environment where it’s always Friday.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nAs the global leader in third-party hotel management, our growing portfolio represents over 1,550 hotels in all 50 states and 22 countries, from top international lodging brands to luxury hotels, destination resorts and lifestyle hotels.
