a lot of time to deal with the original data set.\nC.\nTime:from 2014 September to October Title: Classify Song Release Period Brief process: construct the classification model to classify a specific song into the year before or after the year 1986 based on 90 attributes of a single song and 6480 songs.\nAchievements from the project: use the Multivariate adaptive regression splines to build the model and based on the final classification model, we can conclude that if the song is from before or after on 1986 depends mostly on the artists who create them, secondly on properties they tagged by
