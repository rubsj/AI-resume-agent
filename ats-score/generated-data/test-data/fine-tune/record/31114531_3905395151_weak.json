The Trailblazer Summer Concert Series at\nthe Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and\n2016.\nBy changing the way tickets are\nmarketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have also created a scholarship\nprogram for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported\ntwelve students in 2016. I sought and obtained donations from the community in\norder to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent\nimprovements to the aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including\nadding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound\nequipment.\nAll of this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\n\n03/2014 to Current\nDirector of Programming Arts\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nAs the Director of Programming Arts\nat Dixie State University, I am responsible for the cultural arts activities at\nmultiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity\nConcert Series (CCS) which has been the premier performing arts series in\nthe area since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCS and\nmy duties include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration, and\nfulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting with and guiding the\nCCS Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts\nenthusiasts.\nThe CCS plays host to a wide variety of entertainment genres.\nOur current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony,\nThe Drifters, GENTRI, and Canadian Brass to name a few.\nI am also responsible, during the\nsummer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner\nAmphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before\nI came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists\nplaying weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue\nby adding visual design elements, incorporating concessions and catering,\nseeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming\naround two series formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each\nperformance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a\nstandalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important,\nwell-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the\ntourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National\nPark.\nThe second series is an original\nshow called, \"Sanctuary: The Story of Zion\" which was written to\ncorrespond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co — created , produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance\nand tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area\nbusiness owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be supported by\nthe tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National\nPark though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of video projection to\nshare testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class\nartists and climbers who call Zion home.\n\n01/2010 to Current\nBoard of Directors Member\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nSUSWA continues to be a creative force in the Southern\nUtah area by providing a platform for an active group of like-minded\nindividuals interested in the art of songwriting and performance.

From serving area musicians in a state-of-the-art studio, to\ncreating production music that has been featured on such networks as Discovery,\nDisney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with\na talented staff of creative minded engineers and musicians.\nSpiral Studios has also been\ninvolved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists and providing A/V equipment.  In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able\nto create many industry relationships with both entertainers and\nmanagement.  These relationships have\nallowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an\nentertainer as well as a director.  This\nknowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of\nProgramming.  I continue to own Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.\n\n01/1994 to Current\nMusician\nCompany Name\n－\nState\nAs a touring/performing musician, I have had the opportunity to travel the world.  This musical ability has been the backbone of my career as I have transitioned from performing to audio engineering to managing performing arts facilities and concert series.  This experience allows the unique position of a deep understanding of multiple sides of the industry.  As I communicate with touring musicians, I have an intimate knowledge of the challenges they face.  I completely understand the technical demands and needs of the events I manage.  Lastly, I have a firm grasp on marketing and management, which has been central to my 25 year career.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Science :\nPsychology\nBrigham Young University\n— City , State ,\nUnited States\nMinor in Business with an emphasis in Marketing.\n\nAFFILIATIONS\n\nSUSWA (Southern Utah Songwriters Association) - Board of Directors  Celebrity Concert Series - Board of Directors, Chairman Warner Chappell - Staff Songwriter Scorekeepers - Songwriter Amphibious Zoo - Songwriter\n\nSKILLS\n\nSales Software: Showare Audio/Video Software: Pro Tools, Qlab, Adobe Premiere Desktop Publishing Software: Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Wordpress Microsoft Office Suite\n<RESUME_END>\n\n<JD_START>\nJob Title: Lecturer School Counseling\n\nLocation: Oxnard, California, United States\n\nEmployment Type: full-time\n\nListed Skills: Education, Training\n\nDescription:\nProgram: Educational Leadership and School Counseling & Psychology\n\nRank: Lecturer Faculty\n\nTitle:  Lecturer School Counseling\n\nAbout The University\n\nCalifornia State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) opened in 2002 as the newest campus in the California State University system.
