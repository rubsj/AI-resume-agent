and invented five topics that would be in every issue.\nI helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently.\nEach student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section.\nThey would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template.\nStudents would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic.\nIt turned out great and we were able to publish four issues.\nThis will be our second year.\nThis was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School.\nI had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work.\nIt was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.\n<RESUME_END>\n\n<JD_START>\nJob Title:
