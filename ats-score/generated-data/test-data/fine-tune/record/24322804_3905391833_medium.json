integrators.\nThis role required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain.\nI currently hold the position of Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader.\nThis role includes maintaining & improving line OEE and doing so within the limitation of a parts, labor and capital budget.\nMy team and I review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule.\nI am responsible for developing the skills of 34 mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis.\nAlso, I am responsible for training mechanics to ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State Regulatory Laws.\nFrito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs.\nMy college career at MTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience.\nMy experience would make me a great candidate for this position at your facility.\nThank you for taking the time to look at my resume and considering my request.\nSincerely, Aaron Lovely Engineering Maintenance manager, who is a self-motivated, passionate individual
