Influence and drive alignment with Marketing, Sales, Customers and Finance to create new product launch forecasts· Coordinate cross-functional research activities to reconcile significant variances and refine the forecast model to reflect updated sales and marketing assumptions.Monitor & measure performance vs. the forecast throughout the month identifying any key shifts or trends.Maintain & develop metrics & key performance indicators (KPI's)Analyze forecast variation/deviation with the goal to minimize service issues and prevent the build of excess & obsolete inventoryData integration from forecasting software to MRP software· Use and maintain the Demand Planning software as the primary forecasting system tool.Maintain planning parameters within MRP softwareBalance inventory within Scosche's multi-site environment.Provide operational support for order allocation & fulfillment during key fiscal deadlines: period, quarter, and year-endContinuously monitor sell-through, inventory levels, bookings, and shipping trends to provide direction on necessary adjustments to either demand or supply planning. Anticipate the results of these trends or changes and initiate adjustments when the results will negatively affect plans or commitmentsRecognize underlying themes and patterns, reduce sophisticated data to a few key conclusions that can be actionable and easily understood by others to guide final decision making and trade-offsAlign with Supply Chain and Fulfillment teams on demand handoffConfidently present own position despite resistance or unfavorable reactions from othersSee connections between Supply Chain actions and strategic business outcomes, apply data driven decision makingKey Results:· A demand forecast which incorporates current and accurate market information.
