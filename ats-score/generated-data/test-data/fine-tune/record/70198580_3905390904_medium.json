The work includes extensive travel assignments. \n\nQualifications\n\nMinimum eligibility requirements for positions in this occupation are based on possession of the appropriate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) pilot certificates and/or appropriate military ratings, meeting the applicable flight hour requirements, and possession of the knowledge and skills required for the positions. Certificates and Ratings: For all grade levels and specializations, candidates must possess a current Commercial Pilot Certificate or the appropriate military rating; both meet the intent of the requirement. If an agency decides, for example, not to accept the military rating, the rationale for the decision should be based upon the requirements of the position and should be thoroughly described in agency operating material. For flight instructor positions, the FAA Flight Instructor Certificate or the military equivalent rating is also required. The pilot certificate must include the rating(s) appropriate to the work of the position to be filled. For example, a position that involves flying a multi-engine airplane to various destinations under instrument flight rules would require the Commercial Pilot Certificate with the airplane, multi-engine, and instrument ratings or appropriate U.S. military ratings. Positions that require flying or instructing in flying both airplanes and helicopters require a rating in both categories. Only those ratings necessary to perform the work are required. Note: Candidates establishing eligibility based on military flight experience must provide official orders, forms, or logbooks showing their status as a rated military pilot, flight instructor, or flight examiner, as appropriate. Other certificates that meet or exceed the requirements of the Commercial Pilot Certificate are also acceptable, e.g., an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate. Flight Experience: Candidates must demonstrate possession of the knowledge and skills required for the work by meeting certain minimum flight hour requirements, including recency of flight experience. The categories in which candidates are required to demonstrate proficiency relate to (1) the general knowledge and skills to pilot the aircraft, and (2) the specific knowledge and skills related to the particular position being filled. Only that flight experience that is directly related to the work of the position is required for purposes of establishing minimum eligibility. Minimum Flight Hour Requirements 1.Total Flight Time -- 1500 HRS - Flight time as pilot-in-command or copilot in aircraft of any weight or category is creditable for this requirement. 2. Pilot-In-Command -- 250 HRS- Only flight hours acquired as pilot-in-command are creditable. 3. Night Flying -- 75 HRS4. Flying Time, Last 12 Months --100 HRS-- Required only for positions that involve flying. FOR THE GS-11 LEVEL: Applicants who meet the Minimum Flight Hour Requirements are qualified for the GS11 grade level. Note: There is no education substitution for this grade level. Medical Requirements: At the time of initial appointment, candidates for all pilot positions must possess a current first or second-class medical certificate in accordance with FAA regulations; both meet the intent of the requirement. If an agency decides, for example, not to accept the second-class medical certificate, the rationale for the decision should be based upon the requirements of the position, and should be thoroughly described in agency operating material. Staff specialists not involved in the operation of aircraft need only have a medical examination indicating that they are able to perform the duties of the position to be filled. For flight test pilots, airspace system inspection pilots, and Customs pilots, all candidates must possess a current first class medical certificate at the time of appointment. Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional, philanthropic, religious, spiritual, community, student, social). Volunteer work helps build critical competencies and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment. You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. \n\nMajor Duties\n\nThe duties described are for the full-performance level. At developmental grade levels, assignments will be of more limited scope, performed with less independence and limited complexity.The duties may include, but are not limited to:Operate special purpose aircraft along flight lanes to dispense sterile insects over designated areas throughout the United States.Pilot aircraft as required to conduct research and development tests for applying agricultural chemicals and delivering biological control specimens at low altitudes and minimum controllable speeds.Prepare maps using specialized computer hardware and software to include Global Information System (GIS) programs using various formats of latitude and longitude coordinates.Download and upload flight data to program computers and onboard precision guidance systems, and prepares daily flight records and required reports.Coordinate both ground and flight activities with program, aircraft, and equipment personnel to ensure that program objectives and schedules are accomplished.Perform other duties as assigned which may include preventive maintenance on and the cleaning of airplanes and special purpose equipment. \n\nPosition Start Date:\n\n04/19/2024 \n\nPosition Close Date:\n\n05/03/2024 \n\nSalary Offered: 72553.0 - 94317.0 USD Per Year\n\nYou can make a difference!
