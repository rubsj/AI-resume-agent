values,exposures and related analytics using operational data store(ODS).\nThis product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future).\nA game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.\nDesigned and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.\nDelivered many quality products to production well in time and

a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design.\nThis product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington.\nThe new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in
