advancement and professional development.\n\nSKILLS\n\nAutoCAD, Ansys, Cero, CATIA, HyperMesh, DFMEA, MS Office Suite, Fortran, C, MATLAB/Simulink, CNC Programming\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nDec 2016\nCompany Name\nIdentified technological changes, key issues, trends, design and refined the vehicle definition.\nIllustrated vehicle design and highlighted major interior and exterior dimensions of the vehicle concept.\nPresented a technology plan on the above parameters.\nSimulation and Analysis of 1-2 Shift Processes of a 6-speed FWD AT, University of Michigan — Dearborn , March 2017.\nEstablished a mathematic model for the transmission-vehicle system consisting of general state variable equation, specific state variable equation for the 1st gear, 1-2 shift process and 2nd gear operation.\nSimulated the launch of the vehicle from rest in 1st gear, initiated 1-2 shift at a speed of 15 mph, and 2nd gear operation for 2 seconds with an open torque converter and a fixed throttle position using MATLAB/Simulink.\nReduced torque overshoot by spark retarding, and careful calibration of the oncoming clutch.\nFurther, torque hole was reduced to maximum extent with help of spark retard.\nModelling of Vehicle cooling system, University of Michigan — Dearborn , November 2016.\nBuilt a Simulink model of vehicle cooling system consisting of four sub models namely, engine operation, air flowrate, coolant flowrate and heat transfer.\nDetermined coolant flow rate, heat rejection from the engine, and engine outlet coolant temperature for different vehicle speeds by executing the simulation model.\nComputational Analysis of Hemispherical Radiating Fin, Visvesvaraya Technological University, April 2015.\nDerived heat transfer equations by using two-dimensional conduction equation in spherical coordinates and subjected the same to radiative boundary condition, with constant base temperature.\nSolved derived equations using Finite Difference Method and Gauss-Seidel iterations by writing a code in FORTRAN 95.\nDetermined Heat transfer improvement as a function of thermal conductivity and emissivity, with and without irradiation.\nThe hemispherical fin starts to radiate heat for thermal conductivity > 3 (W/mK) and absorbs heat for thermal conductivity < 3=\"\">\nEngineering Intern\nJan 2016\nto\nJun 2016\nCompany Name\n－\nCity\nCompleted basic and advanced level of training from regional training office of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.\nImplemented 5S, Kaizen, Poka-yoke in servicing of automobiles.\nOverhauled Engines and Transmissions with assistance of technicians.\nCarried out tasks such as inspection and replacement of clutch, common rail, glow plugs, spark plugs, head gaskets, shims, tappets, brake pads, brake shoes, brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, EGR systems, VVT systems, engine filters, fuel filters, wheel bearings.\nGained knowledge in working of CAN Bus systems.\nAssisted technicians in cylinder compression test,
