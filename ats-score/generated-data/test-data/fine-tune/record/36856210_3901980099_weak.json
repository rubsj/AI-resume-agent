Responsibilities then increased to include all\ndepartmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful\nATOs. Now, working on 4 new accreditation including\nre-authorization for an existing project. Succeeded in writing and\nimplementing vulnerability management for existing accredited\nsystems.\nSuccess\nof the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in\ncritical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly\ninto the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise\nbusiness model to understand the best fit for the program.\nThe\ndifferent projects required careful management of specific STIG\ncompliance and hardening for the different configurations and\nservices required for the specific domain to be integrated.   Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.   Supervised 5 external computer consultants and vendors.   Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.\nCompany Name\nCity ,\nState\nSystems Engineer\n\n02/2006 to 02/2011\nI was Hired\nto initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements. Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new\ntechnology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing\npower.  The next challenge  came as storage requirements for better performance and more\ncontrolled uses. After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was\nadopted to grow local storage to over 200TB. In using this solution,\nthe department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and\nmaintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and\naccredited for operation in the Enterprise.  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from\n30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru\nhigher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru\nthe traditional process.\nCompany Name\nCity ,\nState\nSenior Systems Analyst\n\n02/1999 to 02/2006\nI was hired to improve corporate and\nclient communications and processing requirements which resulted in\nthe design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions. One\nsolution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington\nNavy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities.\nFulfilled\nrequirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware\nweaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for\navoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru\ndocumenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to\nunderstand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nAssociate of Science : Electronic Engineering\nFlorence Darlington Technical School ,\nCity ,\nState\nElectronic Engineering.\nDean's list for high GPA.\nClass President for second year\n\nSKILLS\n\nActive Directory Hardware Engineering Information Technology Red Hat Enterprise Linux Servers MS Windows Servers MS Windows Desktop Network Design & Troubleshooting Architectural Diagrams Accreditation Boundarys Risk Management Enterprise Strategies Vendor Relations\nDesktop Publishing Software: Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML Team Work Collaboration\n<RESUME_END>\n\n<JD_START>\nJob Title: Manufacturing Engineer on W2\n\nLocation: Tulsa, OK\n\nEmployment Type: full-time\n\nListed Skills: Engineering, Information Technology\n\nDescription:\nTitle: Manufacturing EngineerLocation: Tulsa, OKDuration: Full Time\nJob Overview:Under general direction, responsible for complex planning activities related to equipment layouts in plant, office, and production facilities.Conducts studies that determine the most efficient sequence of operations and workflow and recommends methods for maximum utilization of production facilities and personnel.Prepares cost estimates for proposed projects and evaluates cost factors.Provides work leadership and training to lower-level professional employeesWhat Your Day-to-Day Activities Will Be:Develops and evaluates manufacturing methods to eliminate waste, improve safety, enhance performance, and identify opportunities for improvement.
