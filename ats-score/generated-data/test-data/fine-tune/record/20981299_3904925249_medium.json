Designed a manually operated juicer using CATIA V5, prototyped the part using additive manufacturing (3D Printing), used benchmarking, customer surveys, DFMEA and brainstorming methodologies to build its business portfolio using lean canvas.\nOccupant package design - Assessing driver requirements like seat track length, head clearance, entrance height, steering wheel height and diameter, accelerator heal point and other important driver's requirement to design a new compact sedan with the help of Anthropometric data and SAEJ1100v005, SAEJ1516v002, SAEJ1517v002 and benchmarking analysis.\nVehicle package analysis and evaluation of cargo compartment - Analyzed vehicle attribute requirements like cost, quality, operation and packaging of cargo compartment by benchmarking three entry level sedans and evaluating the results using ANOVA for customer feedback reliability.\nAnalysis of driver door interior trim panel using Quality function deployment (QFD) - Evaluated HMI logical layout and packaging of systems in interior trim panel by benchmarking compact sedans, interviewed customers for user experience, used QFD to take suggestions to find area of improvements.\nExterior and mechanical package analysis - Developed interface diagram and interface matrix to represent various functions between components.\nStudied vehicle anatomy by decomposing the vehicle into systems, sub — systems , and components.\nVehicle body side aperture spot welding - Conducted detailed analysis of spot welding of BIW, determined robot base and end effector motion and the factors for complete station design using 4M.\nGearbox FMEA - Conducted detailed study on potential failure causes in 6X4 truck gearbox casing failure in fracture using DFMEA and PFMEA.\nImplemented DFA and DFM to derive optimal design for ease of assembly and disassembly of gearbox casing.\nDesign for assembly - Proposed assembly line for plant with 138 stations for volume requirement of 240k vehicles, analyzed the JPH, throughput, bottleneck, labor hours, number of shifts and operators, length of station and line speed.\nSix Sigma - Implemented lean six sigma concepts to improve the efficiency of base coat usage at body paint shop by DMAIC methodology.\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\n04/2018\nMaster of Science :\nManufacturing Systems Engineering\nUniversity of Michigan Dearborn\n— City , State\nManufacturing Systems Engineering\n06/2013\nBachelor of Engineering :\nMechanical Engineering\nVisvesvaraya Technological University\nMechanical Engineering\n\nSKILLS\n\nanatomy, AutoCAD, benchmarking, CATIA, CNC, cost analysis, ergonomics, lean manufacturing, manufacturing process, Minitab, packaging, process engineering, Product Development, surveys, validation, welding\n<RESUME_END>\n\n<JD_START>\nJob Title: Industrial Sales Representative\n\nLocation: Leetsdale, PA\n\nEmployment Type: full-time\n\nListed Skills: Business Development, Project Management, Sales\n\nDescription:\nAbtrex Industries, Inc, a 50+-year-old family business whose purpose is to protect our customer’s assets and the environment from the bad stuff welcomes you.We all work together to double in size as a turnkey manufacturing and installation company within the next 5 years.We specialize in Abtrex rubber linings, our sweet spot.
