01/2015\nMember of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.\nThroughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different geometries inside a wind tunnel.\nPressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.\nThis project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.\nIt is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.\nAlso, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.\nUpon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nBachelors of Science : Aerospace
