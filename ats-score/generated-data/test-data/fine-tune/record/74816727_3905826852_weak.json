effective and efficient methods of teaching while focusing on the individual needs of each student.\nHighlights\nCentral Missouri Math Educators club member Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics 2014 Conference\nTutoring experience MS Office proficient Organized\nTimely\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nWhile working for Beauty Brands I received two awards.\nI received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year.\nThe Award of Excellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district.\nOut of seven locations I was chosen for my district.\nI was presented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City.\nI accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in front of all of home office, location managers, and other award winners.\nThe next year I was awarded with Shift Manager of the Year for my district.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nI have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience.\nSixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill.\nFifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents.\nI spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education and special education classrooms.\nI finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School.\nOne of my peers and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles.\nOne lesson we taught was reviewing order of operations.\nSince the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various problems using multiple operations.\nWe played “I have, who has?” As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the board so that they could visualize it and write it down.\nStudents would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card.\nThe students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.\nWork History\nCompany Name\nJanuary 2014\nto\nCurrent\nTeacher\nCity ,\nState\nAssigned to care for eight 18 month to 24 month olds on campus of
