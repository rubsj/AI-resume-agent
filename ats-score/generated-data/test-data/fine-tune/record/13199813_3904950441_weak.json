Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market.\nAustin\n- I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas.\nDenver\n- When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a \"pitchy, preachy\" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format.
