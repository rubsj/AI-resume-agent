for orders.\nA close attention to inventory management resulted in quick lead times by making sure stock was available for custom items that customer started to purchase.\nEvery aspect of training for the inside sales position at D.A.R. was on the job.\nThis gives me great confidence to branch out into other industries if so given the chance.\nMusic Teacher/Camp Counselor\n\n01/2003 to
