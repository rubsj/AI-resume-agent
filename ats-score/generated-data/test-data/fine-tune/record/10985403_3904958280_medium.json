Fabricates metal parts, such as steel frames, columns, beams, or girders, according to blueprints or instructions from supervisors. Unloads and positions prefabricated steel units for hoisting; hoists steel beams, girders, or columns into place, using cranes or signaling hoisting equipment operators to lift and position structural steel members. Verifies vertical and horizontal alignment of structural steel members, using plumb bobs, laser equipment, transits, or levels. Cuts, bends, or welds steel pieces, using metal shears, torches, or welding equipment. Forces structural steel members into final positions, using turnbuckles, crowbars, jacks, or hand tools. Pulls, pushes or pries structural steel members into approximate positions for bolting into place. Bolts aligned structural-steel members in position for permanent riveting, bolting, or welding into place. Assemble hoisting equipment or riggings, such as cables, pulleys, or hooks, to move heavy equipment or materials.\n\nQualifications\n\nExperience as an Ironworker Craftsman in a powerplant/industrial setting is required.Must possess working knowledge skills and abilities for position.Ability to understand, follow and transmit written and oral instructions and communicate effectively with management/supervision.Ability to use hand tools, power tools and layout tools safe and efficiently.\n\nRequirements\n\n The person in this position needs to constantly move about a construction/industrial site,\n\nso should be able to stand, walk, sit, reach, stoop, kneel, crouch, and/or crawl\n\n Constantly works in a construction environment and will be exposed to changing outdoor\n\nweather conditions\n\n Work irregular hours, weekends, overtime and holidays as required May be required to use ladders/mechanical platforms/manlifts/scaffold to access\n\nrequired equipment/work areas (may exceed 200 feet), so must be able to climb and\n\nmaintain balance on formwork, steel formwork, stairs, ladders and scaffolds\n\n Move and work in and around confined and cluttered places, and uneven surfaces Must be able to complete tasks in a noisy and dusty environment May be required/able to move items weighing up to 50 pounds across\n\nconstruction/industrial site\n\n Must have required tools Observe and comply with all safety and project rules, perform other duties as required Ability to pass pre-access drug and alcohol testing, fit for duty medical and background\n\ncheck\n\nWe are an Equal Opportunity Employer.
