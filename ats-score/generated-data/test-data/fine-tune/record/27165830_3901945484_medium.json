Insight Global is one of the world's largest staffing firms. What does that mean? We make hiring easy for our clients. Since 2001, we've expanded from a small entrepreneurial startup to over $4 billion in revenue. Our growth is driven by our award-winning company culture, comprehensive training programs, and of course, our people. We pride ourselves on hiring elite entry-level sales candidates because we believe in promoting within. Each employee starts as a Recruiter before earning a promotion to Account Management.As an entry-level Recruiter, you’ll be supported by a team of mentors to show you the ropes and give guidance every step of the way. From day one, you’ll be immersed in The IG Way, a cutting-edge training program designed to not only teach how we operate, but also how to accelerate your sales career.\n\nRECRUITER The purpose of the Recruiter role is to build the foundation for a successful sales career at Insight Global. As a Recruiter, you’ll learn all about staffing and our services – and how to sell them to current and future clients. You’ll play the role of matchmaker for companies and candidates by reviewing resumes from our internal database and online job boards, conducting phone interviews, preparing candidates to meet hiring managers, and ultimately negotiating job offers to get them hired.The average employee spends approximately six months in the Recruiter role before enrolling into either Account Manager Training (AMT) or Professional Recruiter Training (PRT). The next 8 to 12 weeks, you'll be working to earn your promotion into either role by applying the skills and knowledge you learned to real-world scenarios with your future clients.\nACCOUNT MANAGER Account Managers are the face of our organization. They work directly with hiring managers at Fortune 1,000 companies by researching and targeting organizations in need of staffing services. They make an initial connection through networking and cold calls, ultimately becoming valuable business consultants and building long-term relationships with their clients. Account Managers run in-person meetings and lunches to get to know hiring goals, team dynamics, and sell how our services can elevate their business. They’ll then gather job requirements and work hand-in-hand with our Recruiting team to find the perfect candidates to fill each role. Account Managers don’t sell a product, they sell staffing and are experts when it comes to all things hiring.\n\nPROFESSIONAL RECRUITER When it comes to Professional Recruiting, think next-level Recruiting and a different take on inside sales. Professional Recruiters are experts in their craft, focused on job seekers and our consultants. Their job is to identify top talent, then work to pair those candidates with the perfect job. They get to know the experiences and career aspirations of each job seeker to match clients to consultants. Once the placement is made, our Professional Recruiters continue to work closely with each consultant guaranteeing a world-class experience and offering continued support throughout their careers. Our Professional Recruiters accounted for over 80% of our job placements last year.\n\n\nWHO WE HIRE:We’re focused on hiring the best talent, regardless of major, school, or experience.
