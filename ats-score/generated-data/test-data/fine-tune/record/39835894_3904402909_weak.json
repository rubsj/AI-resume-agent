Client: Intel USA\nI am currently being trained in Genesys tool and 10nm Intel flow.\nI am working on blocks like LDO to begin with.\nClient: Qualcomm Pvt Ltd India\nWTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 14FF (Samsung foundry) : Duration of project - 6 months\nI managed a team of 6 who worked on WTR synth project done in 14FF Samsung foundry.\nThis is one of the most challenging tasks in my career, as this is the first RF task that I have worked in FF technologies.\nTo overcome the challenges I have undergone various FinFet related trainings to understand the process and its impact on layout.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nEngineering Project Manager ,\n\n12/2012 to 06/2017\nCompany Name\nI used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.\nI also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.\nThese sheets certainly helped us to plan the next project much better.\nWTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 6 months\nI lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.\nMy role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables.\nI also handled some portion of the TOP level layout tasks.\nI worked on blocks like HFVCO, Regulator, VCO Buffer and LPF during this project.\nI used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.\nI also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.\nWTR QLNA Daisy Chain 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months\nFor this particular project I had regular discussions with the Packaging team to create the best Daisy Chain structures for a WLP CHIP which I had work on previously.\nI also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.\nWTR QLNA Metal Variants Tapeout 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months\nWe needed metal variants for the QLNA chip which I previously worked on.\nIn design we leave scope for meal options which can be used to study certain features better during testing.\nHere I worked on creating four chips with different metal variant options.\nI also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.\nWTR QLNA in 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 5 months\nThis was my first project in 180nm TSMC process.\nIn this project I mentored one other junior in my team who worked on MBIAS block while I worked in creating the LNA.\nWTR RX BBF in 28nm (TSMC/UMC) : Duration of project - 4 months\nI lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.\nMy role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables using Gantt chart and XL sheet.\nI worked on the top level and few sub-blocks of BBF in this project.\nWTR FBRX in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 4 months\nThis task was about working on FBRX module which was previously done.\nThere we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications.\nMy role in this task was to identify the IQ imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them.\nI was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done.\nWTR Low Band Low Noise Amplifier 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 3 months\nThis is a Low Band LNA which operates between 860 - 900 Mhz frequencies.\nHere layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout.\nMajorly the input devices to which RF_IN signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry.\nWTR Mixer, Attenuator in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 10 months\nThis is the first project which I worked on in RF domain and I had a wonderful experience working on this project.\nThe blocks that I worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project.\nThe blocks were ready on time with good quality.\nSenior Analog Layout Engineer ,\n\n10/2011 to 12/2012\nCompany Name\nMember of Technical Staff ,\n\n06/2006 to 09/2011\nCompany Name\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nBachelor of Engineering : Electrical and Electronics , 2006\nVisvesvaraya Technological University\n— City , India\nElectrical and Electronics\n\nSKILLS\n\nCadence, Data management, database, debugging, features, IQ, layout, layout design, LINUX, meetings, mentor, Windows, migration, next, Operating Systems, Packaging, progress, project management, quality, Real Time, Router, Routers, Sun-Solaris\n<RESUME_END>\n\n<JD_START>\nJob Title: Industrial Engineering Intern\n\nLocation: Tacoma, WA\n\nEmployment Type: full-time\n\nListed Skills: Management, Manufacturing\n\nDescription:\nCompany Description\n\nNS BlueScope -
