Wrote initial code for some core modules like file system and\napplication management, led the development of other modules for the\nstack - security framework, JMF and Java TV subsystem, interactive\naudio, graphics subsystem (based on AWT, HAVi and DVB extensions)\nand all other BDJ specific modules. Led the efforts on all\ncertifications required for BD-J ( JAVA, BD+, BD-J APIs ).\nWorked\non supporting the product in market after shipment.\nPlayed\ncritical role in development and architecture of OCAP middleware,\nthe technology was later sold to a third party. Contributed to\nspecification group for OCAP. Worked on architecture of application\nframework, security framework and file system and some other modules,\narchitected and wrote the code for most complex component of OCAP -\nDSM-CC file system.\nDevelopment\nof Advanced Media Player, this media player had a Blu-ray player at\nits core and other network enhanced functionality for video\nplayback, music, photo management for local and remote content, this\nhad music recommendation features on client device with the help of\nremote server in cloud. Also worked on architecture for making\nclosed and open source code co-exist within the same system.  The media player was modeled as being driven by Restful JSON APIs.\nSenior Software Engineer\nApril 2000\nto\nJanuary 2004\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nWorked\ntowards development of various technologies related to interactive\nTV set-top boxes for different markets.\nDTV4.0\n(Sheep) compact client development for Comcast on PACE Daytona Box\non GI headend.
