a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School.\nOne of my peers and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles.\nOne lesson we taught was reviewing order of operations.\nSince the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various problems using multiple operations.\nWe played “I have, who has?” As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the board so that they could visualize it and write it down.\nStudents would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card.\nThe students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.\nWork History\nCompany Name\nJanuary 2014\nto\nCurrent\nTeacher\nCity ,\nState\nAssigned to care for eight 18 month to 24 month olds on campus of
