Skills Used Business, design & sales skills\nThis retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.  The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.\n\n06/1991 to 09/1994\nOwner/Manager\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nConverted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.\nIndividual offices were rented to independent business persons by the month, cubicles by the day or hour.  All phone calls answered by staff and messages taken.  Secretarial services available to tenants, as well as outside clients, for an hourly fee.  Conference rooms available on a daily or hourly basis.  Other business services included hosting meetings or conferences and publishing marketing materials for tenants and outside clients.\nBuilding was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.  I had moved the business once and paid for build-out of this space.  I couldn't afford to move again;
