Market Consortium (ESMC) / Ecosystem Services Market Research Consortium (ESMRC)  Location: Flexible/Remote  Position Term: Full Time  About Us: ESMC/ESMRC is a pioneering non-profit, member-based ecosystem services market program. Our pre-competitive consortium is dedicated to scaling regenerative agricultural systems via voluntary, market-based mechanisms. Our groundbreaking Eco-Harvest program, backed by our advanced measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) platform, engages a diverse array of agricultural supply chain and value chain partners to create annual improvements to their ecological supply chain footprints. The Eco-Harvest program generates quantified and verified outcomes for carbon sequestration, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased water quality from improved agricultural production systems. We are pilot testing supply chain biodiversity outcomes as well. These efforts meet the needs of corporations and supply chain partners with commitments and objectives such as Net Zero targets, SBTi, SBTN, and the United Nations Sustainable Development (UN SDG) 2030 goals.  Job Summary: ESMC seeks an experienced Project Manager, Grazing & Livestock Systems to join our dynamic team.
