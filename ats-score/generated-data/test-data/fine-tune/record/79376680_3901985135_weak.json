MS Office proficiency Team building expert Proven sales track record Detail-oriented Sales management\nSales Purchasing Quotations Accounts receivable Customer service CAD experience\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nHandled the highest volume account for current employer Developed profitable sales strategy with new product for longtime customer\nProject Management\nSupervised project production efforts to ensure projects were completed to company standards, on time and within budget constraints.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nSales\n\n01/2007 to 02/2016\nCompany Name\nCity

from three different locations as well as drop ship orders.\nResponsible for replenishing stock as needed.\nLarge customer service portion involved with this account.\nFielded technical and specification questions through conference calls between our company's customer as well as the end user customer.\nCoordinated inspections for return items that were either defective, incorrectly supplied or did not meet the customer's needs.\nPurchasing, sales, customer service as well as quotations all fall under the job description of an inside sales representative at DAR since it is a small family owned business.\nStrictly defined roles are not a part of this job.\nVarious situations required different people to take on various responsibilities which is where communication between all stages of an order is pivotal to success.\nThe quotation process would be the most technical aspect of my time at D.A.R.\nCalculating yields on material needed, required amount of labor (what type of labor) as well as the appropriate mark-up for any given product required constant communication between myself and the employees working the fabrication shop.\nMy greatest feeling of satisfaction came from quoting something never done by the company before and having that turn into an actual order.\nAcquired new business for a longtime customer through competitive quotes and quick lead times for orders.\nA close attention to inventory management resulted in quick lead times by making sure stock was available for custom items that customer started to purchase.\nEvery aspect of training for the inside sales position at D.A.R. was on the job.\nThis gives me great confidence to branch out into other industries if so given the chance.\nMusic Teacher/Camp Counselor\n\n01/2003 to
