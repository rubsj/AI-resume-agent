review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule.\nI am responsible for developing the skills of 34 mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis.\nAlso, I am responsible for training mechanics to ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State Regulatory Laws.\nFrito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs.\nMy college career at MTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience.\nMy experience would make me a great candidate for this position at
