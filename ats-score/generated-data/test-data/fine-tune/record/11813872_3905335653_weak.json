values,exposures and related analytics using operational data store(ODS).\nThis product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future).\nA game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.\nDesigned and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.\nDelivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team.\nAs a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my

a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design.\nThis product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington.\nThe new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.\nLed a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.\nDue to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform.\nIBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front

using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.\nMy team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture.\nAs a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture.\nIBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform.\nIBOR+ provides both current and historical(as — of , as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology.\nIBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.\nDesigned,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata.\nThe ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data.\nMy team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.\nDesigned, developed,implemented
