into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles.\nAs the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food.\nI up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs.\nI took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues.\nI was able to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers.\nI rotated around, taking on the responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.\nWork History\nAnimal Caretaker\nJune
