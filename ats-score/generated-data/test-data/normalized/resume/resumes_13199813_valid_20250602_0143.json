As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market.\nAustin\n- I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas.\nDenver\n- When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a \"pitchy, preachy\" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.\nDirector of Business Development/Political Relations Director\n\n01/1998 to 01/2005\nCompany Name\nNorth Carlolina, South Carolina, Georgia After only three months as a field representative in Augusta, Georgia, I was promoted to Director of Business Development covering North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.\nShortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states.\nDuring my tenure, I focused primarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in the three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone.\nFollowing is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed shareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO's and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca — Cola , Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power.\nLeveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to provide even more bid opportunities.\nAs Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley Franklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in the South.\nI also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta political powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.  Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful campaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.\nBusiness Manager/Account Executive\n\n01/1995 to 01/1998\nCompany Name\nState\nI served as an apprentice under my father until I graduated high school, and a house we rebuilt on Tradd Street in Charleston, South Carolina, was voted house of the decade in the 1980's by the Preservation Society of Charleston.\nDuring and after college, I developed my love for and honed my skills in sales and management while running local Firestone Automotive and Tire Stores and later, business-to-business direct cold-call sales for Transworld Systems, an accounts receivables solutions company.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Arts :\nEnglish\nCharleston Southern University\nCity ,\nState\nCompleted degree in English\ntaking 15-18 hours per semester and working a full time job\nthroughout my college career.\nServed as Sports Editor/Reporter\nfor The Buc 'N Print , the university's student operated weekly\nnewspaper.\nExecutive Communication\nDale Carnegie University\nCity ,\nState ,\nUS\nHow to Communicate with Diplomacy and Tact - Emphasis on building relationships and conflict resolution.\n10 Day Spanish Immersion\nDartmouth University\nCity ,\nState ,\nUS\nI successfully completed the 10-day Spanish language learning course conducted by the Rassias Foundation through Dartmouth University.\n\nSKILLS\n\nBusiness Development, Superb\nCustomer Service, Cold Calling, Relationship Building, Marketing, Market\nResearch, Various CRM software products including Salesforce, Salespoint, ZOHO,\nand Outlook, Developing Marketing Materials, Complaint Resolution,\nBusiness-to — business , Cabinets, Sales, Directing Large Teams, Motivating Team\nMembers, Identifying and Capturing New Markets, Public Speaking, Problem\nSolving, Critical Thinking, Leadership, Performance Analysis, and Budget\nDevelopment and Forecasting",
