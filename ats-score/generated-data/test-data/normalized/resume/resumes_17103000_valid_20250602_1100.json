participate in Boeing's Systems Engineering Leadership Program.\nTested and implemented first time quality metrics across Boeing's GS&S division.\nRecognized as a Technical Lead Engineer within the Hardware Engineering Integrated Product Team (IPT).\nLed a hardware team through the successful development and delivery of multiple F-15 training systems to customers including the United States, Korea, Singapore and Saudi Arabia.\nManage a team of sixteen electrical and mechanical engineers who are responsible for the design and development of high fidelity training devices for the US Navy, Royal Australian Air Force and NASA.\nThese devices include the P-8A, F-22 and the CST-100 Starliner.\nLead multiple initiatives with a goal of continuous improvement.\nThese initiatives have included a thirty-five percent reduction in the electrical engineering cost estimating relationship, simplifying the retrofit process, modifying the peer review process, implementing Design To Value and focusing on first time quality.\nWork with engineers on my team to aid them in their career development by providing them opportunities with increased responsibility.\nResponsible for staffing projects in work and new projects as they are awarded.\nDevelop project schedules and monitor performance using Earned Value Management (EVM).\nManage communication between multiple teams including systems engineering, procurement, manufacturing and software engineering.\nLead Systems Engineer\n\n08/2008 to 03/2015\nLed a multi-functional team in the development of hardware systems to support military, space capsule and commercial flight simulators.\nPerformed project management tasks such as working with the customer to define the scope of the project, developing project schedules, generating staffing profiles, and monitoring the project with EVM.\nSupported technical proposals by defining hardware solutions, developing project schedules, assisting in the creation of a Work

simulators for Singapore.\nTeam was able to complete electrical engineering tasks ahead of schedule and under budget.\nInitiated the lean practice of performing hardware checkout in the final phase of manufacturing instead of waiting for manufacturing turnover.\nThis practice resulted in a schedule savings of three weeks per flight simulator.\nValidated electrical engineering drawings met the requirements and were compliant with our drawing standards.\nSupervised the installation of numerous flight simulators throughout the United States, United Kingdom and South Korea.\nElectrical Engineer\n\n11/2001 to 05/2005\nDesigned electrical systems to be integrated in military flight simulators.\nThese systems included AC/DC power distribution, video distribution, control loaders and communication systems.\nDesigned wire harnesses for military flight simulators.\nThis effort consisted of specifying the components, wire and connector sizing, and interfaces.\nDeveloped design specifications, schematics and assembly drawings for the manufacturing of military flight simulators.\nPlayed an integral part in the production of the first high fidelity F-15 flight simulator based on an architecture consisting of personal computers.\nInitiated the trade study to utilize commercially available uninterruptible power supplies instead of custom designed power distribution systems to provide power to simulators.\nResulted in a cost savings of $150,000 per training facility.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\nIndiana University\nBachelor of Science
