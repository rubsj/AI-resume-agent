I stayed on board with the new owners and have improved many areas of their business.\nThe biggest improvements I made were things that save them money.  The martial arts school I work at used a website that charged them $300 a month for information that was just not needed and therefore a waste of money.  I came up with our own in house system.\nI identified what information (tuition, attendance, rank, student's info etc.) we needed on a daily basis, and how to get to that information quickly.  I simply used the excel program, came up with a sheet for each class and modify it to be easy to use for anyone.\nWe can access any information we need quickly and timely; without paying this website.\nWe were paying a lot for internet and phone.  I called around and verified price and contract for a commercial account.  I was able to negotiate a great price and bundle our services.\nWe sell a lot of merchandise at the martial arts gym.  I set up all new whole sale accounts; for equipment and uniform needs.  I researched pricing for equipment, uniforms and office needs (ink, paper, paper towels) and modified our suppliers.  I was able to establish new relationships and new pricing.\nThe dojo relocated in 2016.  When we took over a new space; I planned everything.  The bathroom remodel I came up with the complete redesign and ,some of the construction, I actually did myself.\nI handled every aspect of moving from one location to a new location.  In a time limit of 14 days, we not only moved but opened our doors at new location; all during Christmas/New Year Holiday.\nSince working for ATA, I have revised the way we communicate to students and parents.  I updated our facebook web page, came out with a monthly newsletter, put in place an announcement board, and update our webpage bi-weekly.\nI have planned and executed new rank testings, tournaments, birthday parties, and planned our company events for an entire year in advance.\nI have increased customer satisfaction and supported customers in areas such as conflict resolution in tuition issues, problem solved our cancel and hold policy, resolved our turnaround time on merchandise orders, clarified rules and equipment requirements in writing and revamped our leadership program.\nI manage new student recruitment, marketing needs, student registration, community outreach, parent communications, staff management, ordering supplies, bookkeeping, upgrade selling, and receiving payments Improved family and parent relations for the school.  I created and implemented new schedule, new calendar of events, worked closely with the owners to design and publish the company's website Handles all record keeping (testing, contracts, tuition payments, and inventory).\nChildren's Ministry\nSeptember 2009\nto\nMay 2013\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nCreated a warm and welcoming environment for children, staff and parents.\nHelped maintained the employees and volunteer's schedule.\nLead worship time, small group discussions, and all children's activities.\nSales Associate\nJune 2007\nto\nNovember 2009\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nIncreased sales productivity, as well as, guest service by utilizing different methods of communications.\nEstablished an organized system for daily needs of answering emails, fax and phone calls.\nLearned essential business and management skills by learning the complex computer system to handling site visits with clients and customers.\nTeam Lead Specialist\nOctober 2004\nto\nDecember 2006\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nManaged the electronics department that handled exchanges, returns, purchases, customer service, and complaints, building displays, inventory and managing back stock.\nManaged a team of employees during peak and off-peak seasons that included training.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nEnglish and Journalism ,\nUniversity Of New Mexico\n— City , State\nEnglish and Journalism\nGeneral ,\nNew Mexico State University\n— City , State\nGeneral\nHigh School Diploma\n:\nMayfield High School\n— City , State\nEducational Aide Certification 2015\n\nSKILLS\n\ncomputer knowledge, conflict resolution, contracts, clients, customer satisfaction, customer service, electronics, Email, fax, ink, inventory, leadership, management skills, managing, marketing, access, excel, money, office, power point, publisher, word, newsletter, peak, pricing, receiving, record keeping, recruitment, selling, sales, staff management, phone skills, phone, upgrade, website, web page",
