the duties of Database Programmer/Analyst at Application Development Network (ADN), DoIT which supports University of Missouri System faculty and students through agile and rapid creation of new applications.\n\nPROJECTS:\n\nAtlas:\nDescription:   This project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions.\nThere are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler.\nA tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor submits availability.\nA scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring.\nAlso, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project.\nThe other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task which runs every day.\nResponsibilities:\nCreated a Availability Calendar Grid.\nIn grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week.\nClicking on the cell toggles the availability.\nAutomatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data) Developed C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.\nGot rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled.\nCreated Class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.\nIntegrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website.\nUsed jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations.\nUsed role based authorization for various pages.\nOccupational Therapy:\nDescription:   The goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies.\nAdding functionalities to upload pdf files.\nResponsilities: Created separate Login page for Administrator and Students.\nUsed Active Directory (AD Group) to restrict other department Students.\nDeveloped a web interface for Administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students.\nUpdated the entire application by using new Visual Studio 2013 template which make use of Bootstrap CSS by changing the master pages.\nModified the structure of database to login.\nUsed Redgate SQL Compare to copy the data from database from dev server to test sever.\nReplaced the old ADN Utilities assemblies with new DoIT Utilities assemblies.\nAppInventory:\nDescription:   The goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their developed, ongoing and future projects.\nFor every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group, User Departments etc. and each application has different version.\nFor each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database, platforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc.\nScrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application (Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients.\nAfter starting the project they can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts.\nResponsibilities:\nEntity Framework was used using Database first approach.\nLINQ was used in the DAL (Data Access Layer) to interact with the Database Consumed ADO.Net Entity Frame Work for Entity Data Model, Entities, Relationship Mapping, and Querying Data.\nConsole Application to import the data from CSV files to populate them into the system.\nAutomatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and JavaScript.\nUsed client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in Javascript.\nWorked on agile environment.\nParticipated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and UAT.\nGoAdmin:\nDescription:   GoMizzou is the University of Missouri flagship mobile application, designed to

similar to shopping cart for various departments who met the certain rules.\nResponsibilities:\nUsed Smtp server to send emails with attachment to the email Developed C# Class Library to import the data from the CSV file to system Used LIM Service for late fee assessment Access to page based on the role (Role based authentication)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMaster of Science ,\nComputer
