under budget. ​\nResponsible for engineering estimates and technical write-ups for bid proposals, and provided  product demos to prospective clients during sales presentations.\n​\nMajor Projects:\nCaltrans Devil's Slide Tunnel\n- Value: $7M\nDelivered a greenfield PLC/SCADA/ITS system for the monitoring/control of a mile long tunnel north of Half Moon Bay, CA.  Developed an incident response CONOPS, followed by the design and deployment of a life — safety , emergency incident response management GUI.  This IRM GUI allows tunnel Operators to quickly react to a whole range of emergency scenarios that require evacuation of the tunnel and immediate deployment of emergency first responders.\nEastern Distributor Tunnel\n- Value: $3.5M.    Managed  the upgrade of a life-safety ITS/SCADA system for a major tunnel servicing downtown Sydney.  Commissioning included the hot-cutover of existing tunnel/traffic control systems, which was achieved with minimal downtime. ​\nSenior
