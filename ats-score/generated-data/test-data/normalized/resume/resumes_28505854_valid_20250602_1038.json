The middleware is being designed\nfor a very responsive user experience, minimum copy transfer of\nbuffers along playback/record pipelines, high performance playback\nof multiple contents in several video windows and content security.\nThe middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server.\nLed\na team for developing cutting edge platform software solution for\nset-top box for MSOs.\nThe\nsoftware has several features like HTML5 UI with webkit/QT, home\nnetworking, DVR, content protection, DRM and playback on 2nd screens\nlike iPads etc.\nSoftware is deployed on a Broadcom SoC with Liberty Global in\nPoland and Czech republic. Worked on EOS flavor of this product\nwhich is going to be deployed in some countries in Europe by end of\nthis year. Worked on optimizing the stack for low latency wrt\nresource management and channel changes.\nAlso\nworked on leading a team of developers towards development of\nsoftware components for headless gateway product for home networking\nwith new Intel Chipsets. The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server.\nLed\na group towards porting of Comcast RDK platform on ST Micro SoCs for\nset-tops.\nLed\na group towards porting/development of software for RDK platform for\nRNG150 Comcast platforms.\n​\nEngineering Manager, Architect\nJanuary 2004\nto\nNovember 2010\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nWorked\non development of technologies in the field of consumer electronics.\nLed\na team of engineers towards development of BD-J stack for Blu-ray\nPlayers. Wrote initial code for some core modules like file system and\napplication management, led the development of other modules for the\nstack - security framework, JMF and Java TV subsystem, interactive\naudio, graphics subsystem (based on AWT, HAVi and DVB extensions)\nand all other BDJ specific modules. Led the efforts on all\ncertifications required for BD-J ( JAVA, BD+, BD-J APIs ).\nWorked\non supporting the product in market after shipment.\nPlayed\ncritical role in development and architecture of OCAP middleware,\nthe technology was later sold to a third party. Contributed to\nspecification group for OCAP. Worked on architecture of application\nframework, security framework and file system and some other modules,\narchitected and wrote the code for most complex component of OCAP -\nDSM-CC file system.\nDevelopment\nof Advanced Media Player, this media player had a Blu-ray player at\nits core and other network enhanced functionality for video\nplayback, music, photo management for local and remote content, this\nhad music recommendation features on client device with the help of\nremote server in cloud. Also worked on architecture for making\nclosed and open source code co-exist within the same system.  The media player was modeled as being driven by Restful JSON APIs.\nSenior Software Engineer\nApril 2000\nto\nJanuary 2004\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nWorked\ntowards development of various technologies related to interactive\nTV set-top boxes for different markets.\nDTV4.0\n(Sheep) compact client development for Comcast on PACE Daytona Box\non GI headend. Dynamic Internet Protocol Interface (DIPI) client\nfor DTV Navigator to support Inband IP data transfer to set-top via\nIPGateway. Various types of IP access options viz Force Tuning,\nChannel tracking were developed. IPGateway development, I worked on\nbasic DSM-CC session protocol implementation to provision continuous\nfeed sessions for inband pipe with the Scientific Atlanta DNCS\n(Digital Network Control System) and also provisioning Power TV DIPI\nclients on this CFSs.\nMicro\n1.0 and Micro 2.0 clients featuring Java based TVGuide, VOD, micro\nbrowser and TVTicker. My responsibility in this was to develop\nTuner, MPEG Java APIs, porting of VOD client, TVGuide-CA java layer,\nTVGuide integration, enhancement to data service and other\nintegration and bug fixes.\nWorked\non feature of displaying MPEG I/P frames on a dynamically updated\ncarousel content from a Liberate server.\nOther\npart of my responsibility in the project was to write glue layer at\nmicro JAVA virtual machine for applications using a Multicast File\nSystem protocol to tune to data/video channels and I/P frames.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nM.Tech\n:\nControl Systems ,\nIndian Institute of Technology\n— City , India\nControl Systems\nB.E\n:\nElectrical Engineering ,\nDevi Ahilya University\n— City , India\nElectrical Engineering\nCourse\n:\nMachine learning ,\nCoursera - Stanford\nUSA\n\nSKILLS\n\nLead Development, build teams, mentor, interface with customers and vendors, architect end to end.\nDevelop products in consumer electronics, digital TV, industrial automation, control systems C, C++, JAVA, JVM, Embedded Linux, LXC, Device Drivers  Working with Socs, RTOS - OS9, VXWorks DVB, MPEG, H.264, HLS, MP4 JSON, REST, SOAP, XML,SNMP,TR069 Microcontrollers, hardware Matlab, Octave Mathematical modeling.\nIntegrating content protection systems Agile Methodologies, Scrum, SDLC, project planning and management, leadership",
