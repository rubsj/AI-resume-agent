This procedure were never done before me.\nI studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate the compressor from the combustion chamber.\nWe recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that hold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back.\nThere was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the PLC that controls our reverse osmosis plant.Since we don't have the program, we temporary\nconvert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and\ntimers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the\nequipment and resume our much needed operation.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nMechanical engineer\n\n05/2006 to 03/2012\nCompany Name\nCity ,\nState\nSupervise in the Operation and Maintenance of 8 units of boilers, 7 swimming pools, 12 deep wells and 2 incinerators.\nChanged the two sand filters and installed new chlorine dosing system on the New infantry swimming pool ( size of pool 82 feet by 82 feet) .\nInstalled new deep well pumps and conducted the testing and commissioning.\nMonitor the work of the waste water treatment plant contractor in the installation of pumps and machines and also in the testing and commissioning.\nSupervise in the installation of swimming pool pumps, heaters, surface skimmers and in changing the inlet diffusers.\nSupervise in the installation of boilers and water softener for a small laundry in one of our satellite camp.\nMechanical Engineer / Section Head\n\n11/1995 to 01/2006\nCompany Name\nCity ,\nState\nOver all in-charge in the operation and maintenance of 6 water treatment plants, 2 waste water treatment plants, 8 sewage lifting stations, 15 deep well pumping stations and 2 swimming pools.\nSupervise in the excavation and installation of sewer line from the workers accommodation up to the waste water treatment plant with two lifting stations.\nMonitor and supervise in the excavation and installation of uPVC pipes for potable water and irrigation water in the officers housing Villas.\nReplacing the old corroded and weak pipes.\nReview all the proposals of the different contractor for the new 2 water treatment plants and submit recommendations to the officer in-charge.\nCheck our daily, weekly and monthly reports that includes also the water analysis of the raw and product waters of the waste water treatment plants and the water treatment plants.\nInspect the work of the contractor that digs and bore new wells and also in the installation, testing and commissioning of deep well pumps.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nGraduate :\nMechanical Engineering course\nFEATI UNIVERSITY\nCity ,\nPhilippines\nMechanical Engineering course\n\nAFFILIATIONS\n\nFormer member of Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers\n\nSKILLS\n\nElectro/Mechanical Skill, Trouble shooting, installation of pipes and pumps, problem solver, design of controls for pumps and motors. installation of swimming pool heaters.",
