so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home.\nDuring high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook
