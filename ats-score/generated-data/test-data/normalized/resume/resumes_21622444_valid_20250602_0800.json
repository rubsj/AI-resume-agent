ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol.\nThis task also means I must handle all ordering trough the different distributors and vendors we may use.\nMy job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day, making sushi â€” rolls , nigiri, sashimi, platters etc.\nIm also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may have.\nOver the course of the 6 years i have been employed by Towa, I have gained so much.\nIve matured so much through this job and sushi really has become such a passion of mine.\nI am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my skill set and continue doing what i love.\nI have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.\nAnd I have no problem adjusting to any style or training.\nI will work any days/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary.\nEducational Background\nAssociate of Applied Science : Electrical-Computer Engineering\nSavannah Technical College ,\nCity ,\nState ,\nUnited States\nGED : General Education\nWayne County Highschool ,\nCity ,\nState ,\nUnited States\nWayne County High school Grades 9-11 Glynn Adult Literacy program-GED\n\nSKILLS",
