biotechnology; the last 8 of which have been managing engineers, technicians as well as supervisors, I bring strong technical leadership to any organization.\nI have a solid background in data analysis and statistics that I use to develop and continuously improve all aspects of the manufacturing process with a focus on efficiency and consistency.\nCore Qualifications\nProEngineer/CREO, MiniTab, MS Office Suite, MS Project, MS Visio, Injection Molding, Trackwise, Catsweb\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\n\nManager, Quality Engineering\nApril 2014\nto\nCurrent\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nManage the Quality Engineering Team, the Complaints Department, and the Metrology Department at Alcon's Class II and Class III medical device manufacturing facility.\nResponsible for improving site compliance and reducing recurring deviations through NCR Investigations and CAPA implementation.\nInvestigate customer complaints and interface with regulatory groups to provide feedback to doctors.\nDirect the teams to provide Calibration support for two medical device-manufacturing facilities.\nResponsible for setting priorities, providing direction, coaching, motivation, mentoring and development of both exempt and non-exempt direct reports.\nSenior Engineer II (Managed Process Engineering and Automation Groups)\nMarch 2011\nto\nApril 2014\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nProcess Control Lead Responsibilities added September 2013.\nManaged the Process Engineering and Automation Groups at Alcon's Class II/III surgically implantable optic device and delivery systems manufacturing facility.\nResponsible for setting priorities, providing direction, coaching, motivation, mentoring and development of both exempt and non-exempt direct reports.\nResponsible for the engineering activities and support related to all aspects of the manufacturing process including: Injection Molding, Assembly, Curing, CNC machining, Chemical Processing, and Inspection.\nApplied technical expertise to improve yield of AcrySof® manufacturing.\nHelped to reduce the particulate reject rate for Wavefront product by 50%.\nReduced dimensional failures from 5% to to <0.3% and=\"\" saved=\"\" the=\"\" facility=\"\" ~$1.4m=\"\" in=\"\" labor=\"\" and=\"\" materials=\"\">\nLed the implementation of multiple automation projects, each of which have improved quality, increased capacity, and reduced cycle time with paybacks realized between 1 and 3 years.\nManaged departmental budget, automation budget as well as capital projects to achieve savings of at least $100k without sacrificing service levels.\nSenior Engineer I\nSeptember 2007\nto\nMarch 2011\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nSupervised the Drafting group, Custom Tool Production, Milling, Injection Molding, and Clean Room Engineering Support staff for both Class II and Class III medical device manufacturing.\nSet priorities, provided direction, and supervision to direct reports.\nSpecified, developed, procured, and validated addition of vision inspection systems to the automated milling machines and improved cut quality and consistency of AcrySof® Single-Piece IOLs.\nProvided technical support for

AcrySof Single-Piece IOL manufacturing.\nIncreased output in AcrySof Single-Piece IOL milling by more than 25% while not impacting quality through an iterative process of adjusting key parameters and verifying impact on cycle time and product quality.\nDesigned, built, tested, and validated the prototype packaging and labeling workstation.\nEvaluated prototype for ergonomics and work flow with the help of production personnel.\nModified the design accordingly and built, and validating the remaining 23 workstations.\nValidated improvements to the software after initial release.\nThe resultant stations prevent packaging failures from getting out into the field.\nDeveloped and analyzed proof of concept models to evaluate manufacturing improvements using Pro/E prior to implementation.\nSet priorities, provided direction, and supervision to one direct report\nResearch Engineer\nSeptember 2003\nto\nFebruary 2005\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nDesigned, built, and tested an automated reagent packaging system to improve lot homogeneity and increase manufacturing throughput of Lab-in-a-tube (LIATTM) technology.\nCreated original Labview programs and amended existing programs to improve functionality for numerous test fixtures and automated systems.\nDesigned and built a novel spotting-device for producing protein microarrays compatible with a 96-well microplate format for high throughput applications.\nProgrammed Labview spotting routine for the protein microarray spotting-device.\nTested numerous concepts to develop design parameters of the LIAT analyzer (ie.tube tensioning, segment length, tube diameter).\nAssisted in the preparation of patent applications and responses to examiner's actions.\nPatent Examiner\nJuly 2002\nto\nSeptember 2003\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nReviewed patent applications for compliance with the United States Code and determined novelty of invention.\nComposed reviews of applications and communicated with applicants to assist them through the patent process.\nGraduate Research Assistant\nSeptember 2000\nto\nJuly 2002\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nDesigned, built, and tested an apparatus for producing sol-gel based DNA hybridization arrays.\nDeveloped and troubleshot instrumentation for controlling pad size and placement within an array.\nDeveloped a sol-gel production protocol to provide specific pore size and flow characteristics for use in capillary chromatography.\nCreated aerogel samples, conducted compression testing, and measured the internal surface area.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMaster of Science\n:\nMechanical
