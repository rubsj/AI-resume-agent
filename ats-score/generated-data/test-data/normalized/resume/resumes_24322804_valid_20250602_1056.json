Technology with a concentration in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University.\nI feel that I am a great candidate to be employed in technical role due my education and experience with ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo.\nCourse work for my degree included instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend.\nInstrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in relation to one another.\nEngineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness.\nI was able to use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician.\nAs an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the OEE of automated weld cells.\nTo ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which required my problem solving abilities.\nI was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish.\nIn my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience through the Project Engineer & Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions.\nThe Project Engineer role required me to have excellent verbal and written communication skills.\nWhile holding this position I worked extensively with all departments within the facility on their requests to improve safety, quality & efficiencies.\nI was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders & vendors/ integrators.\nThis role required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain.\nI currently hold the position of Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader.\nThis role includes maintaining & improving line OEE and doing so within the limitation of a parts, labor and capital budget.\nMy team and I review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule.\nI am responsible for developing the skills of 34 mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis.\nAlso, I am responsible for training mechanics to ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State Regulatory Laws.\nFrito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs.\nMy college career at MTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience.\nMy experience would make me a great candidate for this position at your facility.\nThank you for taking the time to look at my resume and considering my request.\nSincerely, Aaron Lovely Engineering Maintenance manager, who is a self-motivated, passionate individual with excellent decision-making skills, is seeking a technical position within an engineering team.\nCourses for an Engineering Technology degree require the ability to learn electrical and mechanical systems.\nSuccessfully put my education to
