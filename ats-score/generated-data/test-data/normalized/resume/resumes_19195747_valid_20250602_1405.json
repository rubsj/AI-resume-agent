Skills Used Business, design & sales skills\nThis retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.  The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.\n\n06/1991 to 09/1994\nOwner/Manager\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nConverted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.\nIndividual offices were rented to independent business persons by the month, cubicles by the day or hour.  All phone calls answered by staff and messages taken.  Secretarial services available to tenants, as well as outside clients, for an hourly fee.  Conference rooms available on a daily or hourly basis.  Other business services included hosting meetings or conferences and publishing marketing materials for tenants and outside clients.\nBuilding was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.  I had moved the business once and paid for build-out of this space.  I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.\nCurrent\nPrincipal\nCompany Name\n— City , State\nConsulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals.\nOriginated and developed creative design concepts.\nAssisted clients with budget considerations regarding products and materials.\nSuccessfully resolved complex technical design issues.\nInterfaced with architects, contractors, sub — contractors , consultants, fabricators, and regulatory agencies.\nSpecified proper products and materials for each project.\nPrepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.\nEstablished at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.  When business was slow (due to recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.  I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.\nTransitional Vocation\nIn 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.  I was owner of income properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.  Within six months, all units were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.\nIn 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment complex.  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I heard while marketing existing floor plans.  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a long waiting list.  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely gratifying.  I continued in this position to the end of construction.  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a Residential Property Management Certificate.\nMy hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAssociate of Arts :\narchitectural/interior design\nNew York School of Interior Design\n— City , State\nArchitecture and interior design history\nFine arts history\nColor theory and application\nLight theory and application\nTextiles Upholstery Window treatments Paint, surface textures, wallcoverings Interior building materials Architectural drawing and perspective rendering Business and marketing principles for designers\nAll courses were taught by professionals in their respective fields with years of practical experience.\nAssociate of Arts :\nbusiness principles and skills\nLansing Business University (Davenport Business College)\n— City , State\nBasic business management principles Business law Office management\nAccounting/bookkeeping Office skills (typing, shorthand, business machines, etc.) Business etiquette\n\nSKILLS\n\nAccounting, advertising, Basic, business law, business writing, computer aided design, Color, com, client, clients, drafting, Edit, email, Interior Design, marketing, Materials, window, rendering, retail, sales skills, sales, shorthand, space — planning , specification, phone, typing",
