developing and testing electronic products.Skilled Electrical Engineer with over 2 years experience refining workflow processes and improving organizational efficiency.Experienced CAD Drafter with solid knowledge of the practical application of engineering science and technology.\nProven ability to manage multiple projects and meet critical deadlines.Dedicated [job title] with excellent technical, analytical and communication skills demonstrated by [number] years of experience.\n\nSKILLS\n\nTraining program implementation Project management Scheduling tools Scheduling tools\nProcess piping Semi-conductor machine design Structural red-line revisions Electrical drafting\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nTesting, Evaluation and Analysis:\nTested equipment to ensure compliance.\nAnalyzed data and provided recommendations which resulted in adoption of new cost-saving equipment.\nResearch and Development\nManaged voice communications R&D department, resulting in three new products on the market and a generation of an excess of $2M in revenues.\nInnovative Design\nDeveloped automated visual inspection system for accepting and rejecting glass flares based on their physical dimensions and geometry, speeding up product sorting process by 100%.\nDrafting\nPrepared sheet metal fabrication drawings, modifications and commercial specification drawings in compliance with company's drafting standards.\nOrganizational Design\nPrepared plans and layouts for equipment or system arrangements and space allocation.\nProject Coordination\nProvided drafting and project set-up support to the communications staff, creating initial to final drawings for two light rail engineering projects.\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\n\nCompany Name\nCity\nAviation Engineer\n\n01/2015 to Current\nEstablished and helped in the production line of the Auxiliary Power Unit overhaul facility.\nFocused on the following APU units: GTCP85-180-L-C, GTC85-56-70A-71-72, and T-62T-40-1 mainly used on C-130 Hercules, and helicopters.\nInvolved in repair scheme design, test cell, operational performance, drawings, manual interpretation, tooling, equipment improvement, and troubleshooting of engine problems, both in house and in the field.\nWorked on instruction writing, reports, as well as building document revisions.\nFor example, quality deficiency reports, purchase orders, quality reports, repair orders, engineering reports, capital expenditures, manual revisions and more.\nDeveloped and optimized tooling, manufacturing, and ground support equipment reviews for open issues or improvements.\nWorked on PT6A, T56, and 501 engines mainly in accessory testing and test cell operations.\nDesigned tooling equipment, electrical circuitry, and hydraulic systems using CATIA V5.\nDesigned and built testing bench for APU using data acquisition system and measurement devices such as digital readouts, pressure gauges, and level sensors.\nProvided technical support to the Accessory shop department, Engineering department, Machine Shop, Test cell, Management, and the Operation's department.\nPerformed receiving and detailed inspection of incoming parts, accessories, and engines to the overhaul facility.\nContact: John McIntosh\nVice-president of engineering\nmobile: (+1 7526269604.\nCompany Name\nCity\nIntern\n01/2013\nProvided technical support in part design using CATIA (computer-aided three dimensional interactive applications) for aircraft implementation.\nParticipated in the improvements of engineering software, and designed several components for fuel controls, starters, coordinators and fuel nozzles for different turboprop engines.\nDeveloped linearization software to help the pre-test process of 501 coordinators.\nContact: Leonardo Marcano mobile: (+1 7862569004.\nCompany Name\nCity\nAerospace Engineer\n\n01/2014 to 01/2015\nMember of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.\nThroughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different geometries inside a wind tunnel.\nPressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.\nThis project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.\nIt is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.\nAlso, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.\nUpon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nBachelors of Science : Aerospace Engineering\nEMBRY-RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY ,\nCity ,\nUSA\nAerospace Engineering\nApplied
