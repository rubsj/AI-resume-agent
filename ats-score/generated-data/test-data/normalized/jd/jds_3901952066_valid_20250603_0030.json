Rady Department of Mechanical Engineering department is encouraging applications for the Material Scientist Postdoctoral Position. With focus on material characterization, development and fabrication, is available from September 2024 onwards for a period of 1.5 years, with a possible extension of another 1.5 years. A start-date of January 2025 could be negotiated for the right candidate. Tasks will include: (1) performing a thorough investigation on the material behavior of polyurethane in fluids from both a functional and safety point-of-view, (2) conducting a novel exploratory study to obtain experimental measurements of hydrodynamic stresses directly in viscous fluids and (3) developing enhanced photoelastic particles with magnetic or piezoelectric capabilities or chemical additives to create cohesion.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with disabilities.\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe postdoctoral position is funded through the Moore Foundation to support a research program on the “fundamental understanding of the underlying physics in nature-inspired liquid-solid suspensions”. As part of this new award, 1 new PhD-student and 2 new postdoctoral research associates will be recruited to help deliver a 5-year body of research, led by Professor Nathalie Vriend at the University of Colorado, Boulder, USA. Our lab investigates granular materials, and we are using a variety of smart experimental techniques to reveal granular rheology. Our target in this program is to capture stress transformations at the particle-scale, to model rheology accurately and precisely, and to obtain unprecedented insight on the solid-liquid interactions in environmental applications such as mushy layers, ice crystals in cold reservoirs, permafrost or cohesive turbidity currents.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be \n\nPerforming a thorough investigation on the material behavior of polyurethane in fluids from both a functional and safety point-of-view.Conducting a novel exploratory study to obtain experimental measurements of hydrodynamic stresses directly in viscous fluids.Developing enhanced photoelastic particles with magnetic or piezoelectric capabilities or chemical additives to create cohesion. \n\nWhat You Should Know\n\nIn my research group, I celebrate diversity and a balanced integration of work, family and private time. I strongly believe that excellence can take a variety of shapes and forms, and a diverse team of people with multidisciplinary backgrounds, approaches, knowledge and skills will produce the best results for our common goals. I want to meet your personal needs such that you can reach your full potential in your professional research career, and therefore I am open to discuss any non-traditional working pattern that you may require to be successful.\n\nWhat We Can Offer\n\nThe annual salary for this full-time position is $60,000/year.$500 in relocation expenses to a successful domestic applicant$1500 in relocation expenses to a successful international applicant\n\nBenefits\n\nThe University of Colorado offers excellent benefits , including medical, dental, retirement, paid time off, tuition benefit and ECO Pass. The University of Colorado Boulder is one of the largest employers in Boulder County and offers an inspiring higher education environment. Learn more about the University of Colorado Boulder .\n\n Be Statements \n\nBe collaborative. Be driven. Be Boulder.\n\nWhat We Require\n\nPhD in related field.Preferred: PhD in a STEM field. \n\nWhat You Will Need\n\nI greatly value initiative, independent thought and creativity above any other restrictive qualifications. Don’t hesitate to apply if you possess these characteristics but encountered an extended period of leave or a non-linear career path.\n\n Special Instructions \n\nTo Apply, Please Submit The Following Materials\n\nCurrent Resume/CVCover LetterReference Letter(s)(Not Confidential)(Optional) Statement Describing Research Related Goals(Optional) Diversity and Inclusion Statement(Optional) Transcripts/Proof of PhD\n\nIf you are selected as the finalist, your degree will be verified by the CU Boulder Campus Human Resources department using an approved online vendor. If your degree was obtained outside of the United States, please submit a translated version (if applicable) as an optional attachment.\n\nPlease email nathalie.vriend@colorado.edu with any questions about this position. We welcome applications on a rolling basis and expect to conduct interviews in May. In your application, we welcome statements about how you could contribute to the scientific goals of this research program, and to the diversity and supportive atmosphere of our research group.\n\nPlease apply by May 15, 2024 for full consideration.\n\nNote: Application materials will not be accepted via email. For consideration, applications must be submitted through CU Boulder Jobs.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
