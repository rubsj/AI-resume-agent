The research in this laboratory focuses on individuals with sickle cell disease and improving our understanding of pain, both the causes of pain and how pain impacts a patient’s health and wellbeing. The laboratory is currently working on developing a biomarker for pain that can be used to determine the impact of new therapies and predict pain episodes. Using a novel technique, we hope to use the signature of a patient’s inflammatory/immune regulation for this biomarker.\n\nWe are interested in an individual with a background in clinical bioinformatics with experience in assimilation and analyses of omics data to enhance our work in this area of scientific discovery. A background in immunology and/or molecular biology is a plus. Further, the ability to write and publish manuscripts is vital to this role. Individuals with experience or background in these areas or related areas are encouraged to apply.\n\nPurpose\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), a postdoc is an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced research training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path. In addition, according to the National Postdoc Association (NPA), Postdoctoral appointees can pursue basic, clinical or translational projects so long as their primary effort is devoted toward their own scholarship. Postdocs are essential to the scholarly mission of the mentor and host institution, and thus are expected to have the freedom to publish the results of their scholarship.\n\nCharacteristics of a postdoctoral appointment:\n\nIt is expected that postdocs at MCW, with the assistance of their supervisor, will:\n\nTransition to career independence through the development of professional skills that enable the postdoc to actively pursue a career of his/her own choosing.Be supervised by at least one senior scholar who actively promotes the postdoc's professional development.Establish an individual development plan (IDP) that incorporates equally the postdoc's career and training goals and the mentor's research goals.Pursue basic, clinical, or translational projects so long as effort is focused primarily on research.Publish results of the postdoc's research and scholarship during their appointment.The postdoctoral appointment is temporary by nature, the aggregate amount of time spent as a postdoc is recommended to not exceed five years (not including family medical leave or maternity/paternity leave).As postdocs are important members of the host institution's community, appropriate levels of compensation, health care, and other benefits commensurate with their essential status should be afforded, independent of the postdoc's source of funding.\n\nPrimary Functions\n\nPlan, design and execute complex research studies, procedures and protocols.Participate in discovery projects.Coordinate research study activities; lead and manage projects.Oversee organization, synthesis and analysis of data and findings.Prepare scientific reports, outcome findings and scientific manuscripts.
