For that reason, it's often referred to as a foundational element of the Platform that is required for any data flow. Identity data is split into two categories. Firstly the IDs themselves. These are used by a number of services and may require explicit consent to collect before they are used. Secondly the links between these IDs. The ID links are used to stitch different first party data sets together to create a robust unified profile. Stitched identities and their associated attributes can then be processed by a number of services to enrich their value (for example profile segmentation). Once processed they are typically activated to provide consistent identity resolution for reporting, attribution and personalization use-cases. Identity resolution is particularly powerful for marketers who are looking to optimize the customer experience for a person that is frequently moving across multiple devices or online and offline touchpoints when completing their customer journey.\n\nAll 2024 Adobe interns will be ‘co-located hybrid.
