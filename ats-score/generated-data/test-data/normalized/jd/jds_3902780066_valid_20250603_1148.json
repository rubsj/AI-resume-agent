The Flowers Lab is focused on Alzheimer’s disease with an interest in APOE, the most significant genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. We utilize mass spectrometry to understand how carbohydrate modifications are altered in AD, and induced pluripotent stem cells and clinical samples to harness this knowledge for the identification of AD before pathology as well as therapeutic targets to stop the progression to AD. The lab is also involved in AD clinical trials and using mouse models to test treatment paradigms. The Flowers lab is NIH-funded and equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation. The Research Technicians will aid us with this important work.\n\nOur new lab members will join and contribute to a welcoming and supportive environment driven to carry out fundamental and translational research to improve AD patient outcomes. They will have many opportunities to expand and learn new lab skills, become confident in the AD field, and improve their science communication skills.\n\nThe successful candidates will be responsible for and help facilitate research in the lab. They will be responsible for the culturing and differentiation of iPS cells, carrying our biochemical and molecular biology analyses and preparing samples for mass spectrometric analyses. They will work with a range of patient samples, maintain the animal colony, carry out experiments and analyze data. They will document and report results to the group. A smaller part of the roles will involve routine but important lab maintenance and administration tasks.\n\nThe new lab members will hold a bachelors degree and at least one year of experience in a lab.
