        "input_text": "Job Title: Postdoctoral Fellow\n\nLocation: Milwaukee, WI\n\nEmployment Type: full-time\n\nListed Skills: Analyst, Information Technology, Research\n\nDescription:\nPosition Description:\n\nWe’re looking for those individuals—the creative thinkers and innovation seekers—who are content with nothing short of changing the world. Discover the endless opportunities within the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and be inspired by the work we can do together to improve health, and make a positive, daily impact in our communities. In the role of Postdoctoral Fellow you will be working in Biochemistry .\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Volkman laboratory conducts NIH grant-supported research in several areas of chemokine biology, with an emphasis on the structural details of chemokine proteins, their interactions with cell surface receptors, and novel approaches to modify their functions in vivo with small molecule or engineered protein ligands. Actively funded projects with multiple years of future grant support focus on 1) the structural basis of chemokine function, with the goal of developing a comprehensive structure-function atlas of the chemokine network of the human immune system; 2) fragment-based development of small molecule inhibitors of CCL28, a chemokine implicated in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer; and 3) the thermodynamic origins of metamorphic folding in the human chemokine XCL1. Additional project details can be found in the NIH Reporter database.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), a postdoc is an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced research training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path. In addition, according to the National Postdoc Association (NPA), Postdoctoral appointees can pursue basic, clinical or translational projects so long as their primary effort is devoted toward their own scholarship. Postdocs are essential to the scholarly mission of the mentor and host institution, and thus are expected to have the freedom to publish the results of their scholarship.\n\nRecent PhD graduates or those anticipating the completion of the PhD degree in the next 12 months in a scientific discipline related to structural biology, computational biology, molecular biophysics, or GPRC pharmacology with an interest in any of the aforementioned projects are encouraged to apply.\n\nCharacteristics of a postdoctoral appointment:\n\nIt is expected that postdocs at MCW, with the assistance of their supervisor, will:\n\nTransition to career independence through the development of professional skills that enable the postdoc to actively pursue a career of his/her own choosing.Be supervised by at least one senior scholar who actively promotes the postdoc's professional development.Establish an individual development plan (IDP) that incorporates equally the postdoc's career and training goals and the mentor's research goals.Pursue basic, clinical, or translational projects so long as effort is focused primarily on research.Publish results of the postdoc's research and scholarship during their appointment.The postdoctoral appointment is temporary by nature, the aggregate amount of time spent as a postdoc is recommended to not exceed five years (not including family medical leave or maternity/paternity leave).As postdocs are important members of the host institution's community, appropriate levels of compensation, health care, and other benefits commensurate with their essential status should be afforded, independent of the postdoc's source of funding.\n\nPrimary Functions\n\nPerform and assist other research personnel with structure-function studies of chemokine-GPCR complexes using NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy and other biophysical and biochemical methods.Perform and assist other research personnel with measurements of GPCR signaling to assess the presence of and structural origins of biased agonism in the chemokine family.Perform and assist other research personnel with high-throughput computational modeling of chemokine-GPCR complexes.Perform and assist other research personnel with fragment-based drug discovery targeting the chemokine network.Perform and assist other research personnel with computational design and experimental characterization of novel metamorphic or fold-switching proteins.Disseminate research results by depositing structures and data in the protein data bank or other public repositories.Prepare research results for publication in peer-reviewed journals as primary author or co-author.Plan, design and execute complex research studies, procedures and protocols.Participate in discovery projects.Coordinate research study activities; lead and manage projects.Oversee organization, synthesis and analysis of data and findings.Prepare scientific reports, outcome findings and scientific manuscripts. Participate in meetings with principle investigator and research staff in which you will evaluate/interpret the validity of data, develop methodologies, and design and evaluate lab procedures.Maintain supplies, may require negotiation with vendors, and track purchase orders.May oversee the work of laboratory personnel including training and development as well as daily work direction, delegation and establishing priorities.\n\nKnowledge – Skills – Abilities\n\nRequired knowledge: biology, chemistry, protein structure, GPCR pharmacology, computer programming, mathematics, bioinformatics, statistics, documentation, records management, data utilization, complex problem solving, critical thinking, resource management, and writing skills\n\nSkills and abilities: This will vary based on the hiring manager’s preferences and should include things that can be learned or trained for.\n\nPreferred Schedule:\n\nM-F 8-5 pm\n\nPosition Requirements:\n\nAppropriate experience may be substituted for education on an equivalent basis\n\nMinimum Required Education: PhD in a scientific field\n\nPreferred Education: PhD in chemistry, biochemistry, molecular pharmacology, biophysics, structural bioinformatics or structural biology-related discipline\n\nField: Structural Biology, Computational Biology, Biochemistry or Biophysics\n\nWhy MCW? \n\nOutstanding Healthcare Coverage, including but not limited to Health, Vision, and Dental. Along with Flexible Spending options403B Retirement PackageCompetitive Vacation and Paid Holidays offeredTuition ReimbursementPaid Parental LeavePet InsuranceOn campus Fitness Facility, offering onsite classes.Additional discounted rates on items such as: Select cell phone plans, local fitness facilities, Milwaukee recreation and entertainment etc. \n\nFor a full list of positions see: www.mcw.edu/careers\n\nFor a brief overview of our benefits see: https://www.mcw.edu/departments/human-resources/benefits\n\nEastern Wisconsin is a vibrant, diverse metropolitan area. MCW is intent on attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse workforce and faculty body that reflects the community we serve. We value diversity of backgrounds, experience, thought, and perspectives to advance excellence in science and medicine. MCW is a welcoming campus community with a strong culture of collaboration, partnership, and engagement with our surrounding community.
