The Pharmacokinetic & Drug Metabolism department (PKDM) is seeking a Senior Principal Scientist to characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of small molecules and emerging therapeutics. This position is based at the Amgen South San Francisco site with on site, hybrid, and/or remote work options for individuals located within the US.\n\nThe Senior Principal Scientist will be responsible for supporting small molecule drug discovery through to clinical development with the opportunity to expand support to other therapeutic modalities, such as antibody drug conjugates, targeted protein degraders, etc. The selected individual will lead teams within PKDM to systematically characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) as well as PK, and PD properties of molecules using in vitro and in vivo models. Also in this role, the Senior Principal Scientist will partner with cross-functional teams to design and identify promising molecules starting from discovery research through to IND and NDA filings.\n\nIn this position, the core responsibilities will include:\n\nServe as a small molecule project team representative demonstrating knowledge of ADME, in vitro to in vivo correlation, in vitro to in vivo extrapolation, and PK/PD.Act as a subject matter expert in biotransformation, including but not limited to classical small molecules, antibody drug conjugates, and targeted protein degradersDesign in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the ADME/PK properties of small molecules, such as solubility, permeability, stability, plasma protein binding, blood-brain barrier penetration, metabolism, clearance, bioavailability, PK, and PDApply software tools to analyze preclinical ADME/PK data and to predict PK parameters and/or pharmacological response of drug candidates across speciesLead and contribute to the preparation of scientific reports and to submission of regulatory documents, such as IND and NDA filingsEstablish positive relationships and collaborations within PKDM and in cross-functional teams to optimize drug candidate profiles including a comprehensive understanding of potential drug-drug interactions and ensuring the selection of the appropriate dose and route of administrationContribute to PKDM’s external eminence through authoring scientific publications and speaking publicly at scientific conferences\n\nWin\n\nWhat We Expect Of You\n\nWe are all different, yet we all use our unique contributions to serve patients. The dynamic professional we seek is a leader with these qualifications.\n\nBasic Qualifications:\n\nDoctorate degree PhD OR PharmD OR MD [and relevant post-doc where applicable] and 3 years of small molecule drug discovery and/or development in industry or similar experience\n\nOr\n\nMaster’s degree and 6 years of small molecule drug discovery and/or development in industry or similar experience\n\nOr\n\nBachelor’s degree and 8 years of small molecule drug discovery and/or development in industry or similar experience\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\nPhD in pharmacology, pharmacokinetic/pharmaceutical sciences, biochemistry, or a related field5+ years of small molecule drug discovery and/or development in industry or similar experienceProject team representative experience within the context of PKDM-related attributesStrong background and/or comprehensive training in small molecule biotransformation including knowledge of in vitro/ in vivo experimental design and analytical instrumentation that would be transferable to other modalitiesExcellent oral and written communication skills and be able to excel in a highly collaborative, matrixed team environmentKnowledge of global regulatory guidance and extensive experience with writing scientific reports, PK written summaries, and/or response to regulatory questions to support IND and NDA filingsExperience with leading teams of multiple scientists and delivering on objectives and key results\n\nThrive\n\nWhat You Can Expect Of Us\n\nAs we work to develop treatments that take care of others, we also work to care for our teammates’ professional and personal growth and well-being.\n\nThe expected annual salary range for this role in the U.S. (excluding Puerto Rico) is posted.
