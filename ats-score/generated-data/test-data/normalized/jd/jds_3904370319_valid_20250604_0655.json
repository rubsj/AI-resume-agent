Eikon’s discovery platform is built on groundbreaking innovations from its founders (Nobel Prize, 2014), culminating in the creation of microscopes which enable real time, molecular-resolution measurements of protein movement in living cells, thereby unlocking otherwise intractable classes of proteins as drug targets.\n\nPosition:\n\nAs a Scientist 2 at Eikon, you will be an essential part of an interdisciplinary team of highly creative and talented individuals with outstanding expertise in the Company’s core platform technologies and drug discovery processes. You’ll play a key role in developing cell-based assays and screening compounds to advance research pipeline for multiple drug discovery programs. You’ll be collaborating and working closely with a team of biologists, chemists, and engineering experts.\n\nAbout you: \n\nYou’re an accomplished cell biologist that has demonstrated expertise in developing cell-based assays for profiling small molecule compounds in an industry setting. You have a deep understanding of small molecule dose-response testing and the ability to design assay testing funnels to identify compounds with desired activity and selectivity profiles. You’re conscientious, detail oriented, and organized. You’re collaborative by nature and are happy to help. You enjoy teaching and mentoring research associates. You thrive in a fast-paced environment and enjoy using novel technologies to advance small molecule drug discovery. You’re passionate about drug discovery and discovering effective treatments for patients.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nDevelop, troubleshoot, and optimize cell-based assays for small molecule compound profiling.QC and analyze screening data to derive quantitative measurements from cell-based assays and upload data into a LIMS database system.Work closely with biologists and chemists to drive hit finding and structure-activity-relationships (SAR) for different drug discovery programs.Keep detailed and organized records of experimental protocols and resultsInterpret and present scientific findings to research meetings. Provide scientific input and propose follow-up studies.Collaborate and communicate across a diverse research team to successfully progress scientific goals.\n\nKey Qualifications:\n\nPhD degree in life sciences with 3+ years of industry experience, or a master Master’s degree with 6+ years of industry experience in cell-based assay development and screening.Proficiency in using lab automation to run robust high-throughput cell-based assays in 384- and/or 1536-well format.Experience working with compound screening databases and LIMS systems.Experience using graphing and data visualization software (Excel, GraphPad Prism, Spotfire, etc).Proficiency in cell biology techniques including mammalian cell culture, transient transfections, stable cell line generation and using siRNA for gene-knockdown studies.Proficiency in a variety of cell-based assay readouts including cell viability, luciferase reporter assays, immunofluorescence, MesoScale, flow cytometry, etc.Keen analytical and problem-solving skills.The ability to communicate clearly and build open collaborative relationships is essential\n\nAt Eikon, employee compensation also includes bonus and equity compensation, in addition to several generous benefit programs, including:\n\n401k plan with company matching Medical (premiums covered by Eikon at 95%), dental and vision insurance (premiums covered by Eikon at 100%) Mental health and wellness benefits Weeklong summer and winter holiday shutdowns Generous paid time off and holiday policies Life/AD&D Insurance (premiums covered by Eikon at 100%) and optional supplemental employee-paid life/AD&D policies Enhanced parental leave benefit Daily subsidized lunch program when on-site \n\nThe expected salary range for this role is $122,000 to $133,000 depending on skills, competency, and the market demand for your expertise.\n\nEikon is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and will consider all qualified applicants for employment.\n\nIn accordance with the Company’s duty to provide and maintain a safe workplace, the Company requires all employees to be Fully Vaccinated with one of the FDA approved COVID-19 vaccines, which includes those vaccines that have received the FDA’s emergency use authorization. You will be expected to be Fully Vaccinated as of your Start Date. If you believe that you are exempt from this requirement under an applicable law or regulations, including Americans with Disabilities Act and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act, you will need to contact the Company’s Human Resources group. For purposes of this section, Fully Vaccinated means (i) the completion of the vaccination regimen as approved by the FDA (by way of example, 2 doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and 1 dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine), and (ii) timely receiving booster vaccination, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWe are currently not accepting any new third-party agencies or firms at this time. Please do not forward unsolicited agency resumes to our website, employees or Human Resources. Eikon Therapeutics will not pay fees to any third-party agency or firm associated with unsolicited resumes.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
