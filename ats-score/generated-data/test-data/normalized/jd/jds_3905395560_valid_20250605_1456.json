Thousands of ecommerce companies, from Hexclad to JIF Peanut Butter, use Replo to build everything from their latest product offers to Super Bowl giveaways.\n\nAbout Us\n\nReplo was founded in the summer of 2021 by Yuxin Zhu and Noah Gilmore. We launched in 2022 and grew to over 1000+ paying customers in just 6 months, with no sales team.\n\nWeâ€™ve raised over $8.2M from Figma, YCombinator, General Catalyst, Infinity Ventures, MAGIC Fund, Base Case Capital, as well as the founders of NextJS/Vercel.\n\nTraction\n\nWe are default alive, and continue to grow double-digit % every month.\n\nFounding Team\n\nYuxin Zhu grew up in New York City and graduated from UC Berkeley (CS â€˜15) and prior to Replo ran engineering, product, and design teams at Uber. In his spare time, he likes to listen to audiobooks, play board games, and snowboard in Hokkaido. Youâ€™ll find him at his favorite restaurant in Tokyo, Menya Itto.\n\nNoah Gilmore grew up in Chicago and also went to Berkeley (EECS â€˜15, same dorm as Yuxin!) and prior to Replo was Principal Engineer at Plangrid, a YC company which was acquired by Autodesk in 2019. In his spare time, he likes working on his blog and assortment of iOS apps (you can learn more at https://noahgilmore.com/!)\n\nWhy We Exist\n\nThe web continues to be the most profitable customer acquisition channel for companies selling services and goods online.\n\nOver the last five years, total digital ad spending in the US has more than doubled to $270B, while customer acquisition costs (CAC) have increased over 60%. As competition increases, there are more software platforms and service providers offering analytics and insights than ever before.\n\nHowever, going from this data to actually optimizing customer acquisition remains exceedingly difficult. Marketing teams have to look at numbers, draw the right conclusions, figure out what to test, how to test it, and often wait days or weeks on other stakeholders â€” including design, copywriters, developers, media buyers â€” before they can even launch new ideas.\n\nThis method is extremely costly and exceedingly slow, because human experience, energy, and time is required at every step on the treadmill of refining customer acquisition. We believe data and AI can not only turn the customer acquisition flywheel â€” it can do so 10x faster, and 100x more cost-effectively than current, human-only methods.\n\nThatâ€™s what Replo exists to enable.\n\nBenefits\n\nWe offer very competitive cash and equity compensation with healthcare/vision/dental and 401K. We will also provide a stipend for work-from-home gear if you need!\n\nðŸŒ† About the Role\n\nOur ideal candidate is a scrappy, self-starter, whoâ€™s comfortable working independently or with a team, based out of Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, or New York. For the right candidate, weâ€™re also open to remote positions at Replo (+/- 3 hour timezone from the Bay Area).\n\nYour Responsibilities\n\nDrive Growth through Engagement: As a pivotal member of our sales team, your primary mission will be to turbocharge Replo's growth by generating and qualifying leads that convert into sales opportunities.

Your on-the-ground insights will be invaluable in shaping Replo's offerings and outbound tactics. Pipeline Development: Build and maintain a robust sales pipeline that supports and surpasses your monthly and quarterly targets. You're not just meeting quotas; you're smashing them and setting new benchmarks for success. \n\nLooking For Someone Who\n\nEmbraces the Hustle: You're tenacious, with a scrappy startup mentality. Obstacles? You see them as opportunities. Your resilience and drive to exceed expectations define you. Sales Savvy: You have a solid foundation in sales principles and are adept at navigating sales cycles. Previous experience in SaaS sales and/or ecommerce is a plus, but not a prerequisite.

Prior experience in a startup or dynamic SaaS company is highly regarded. History In The Ecommerce/DTC Space: If you have worked in the ecommerce space, either at a brand, an agency, or another ecomm SaaS vendor, you should be able to ramp quicker and smash goals sooner. Not a requirement - weâ€™ll still teach you about the space and how our product fits in it + how it impacts the lives of our customersCreative Flair for Engagement: Not just in how you sell, but in how you think. You bring creativity to your sales tactics, finding new and compelling ways to connect with potential customers. Passion for Learning and Growth: You're not just looking for a job; you're looking for a journey. A desire to grow, learn, and evolve within your role and within the company is what we're after. Direct Sales Experience: Though not required, having direct experience in an SDR role, or similar, especially within the SaaS or tech sectors, will help you stand out. \n\nBy joining Replo, you're not just taking on a job; you're stepping into a role that's crucial for our growth and success.
