Our groundbreaking discoveries in basic and clinical research are transforming medicine. We share a singular commitment to advancing science for the benefit of humanity. Our collaborative culture drives each of us to achieve a higher level, fueling the breakthroughs for which we are known. \nThe Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases studies the human genetic and immunological determinants of life-threatening infectious diseases. It aims to understand why some children and adults develop a life-threatening or lethal illness in the course of primary infection, while most people exposed to the same microbe remain unharmed. Work in the lab has revealed that so-called inborn errors of immunity, the genetic variants that affect a person’s ability to fight off infectious agents, can confer selective vulnerability to a specific severe infectious disease. These inborn errors of immunity to infection can be rare or common, and can affect children or adults. They reveal causal mechanisms of disease that can be triggered by other factors, genetic or otherwise. This work provides support for a human genetic and immunological theory of severe infectious diseases.\nWe are seeking a Research Specialist to join our team!\nThe PositionThe Research Specialist is responsible for meticulously cataloging, maintaining, expanding, and generating thousands of immortalized cell lines from our cohorts of patients with various infectious diseases, recruited through a global network of collaborators. This role ensures the highest standards of quality and reproducibility in our research efforts. The Research Specialist will serve as the tissue culture liaison for our two branches of the lab, here at The Rockefeller University, as well as in Paris, France at the Imagine Institute Imagine of the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.\nResponsibilities include:Performing routine maintenance and immortalization/propagation of a diverse array of cell lines, including primary cells, immortalized cell lines, and stem cells, and troubleshoot technical processes (contaminations).Maintaining a centralized database to track all cell line information, including origin, passage number, genetic modifications, and experimental data. Collaborate with clinical research study coordinator to record new cell lines.Fulfilling requests for thawing and expansion of specific cell lines, ensuring accurate documentation and timely delivery.Providing training to new lab members on standard tissue culture techniques, ensuring proficiency and adherence to established protocols. Oversee compliance and organization in tissue culture lab, collaborating with the lab manager to address any regulatory or procedural issues.Continuously assessing and optimizing culture conditions and protocols to enhance cell viability, growth, and functionality, improving research outcomes.Managing supply of common tissue culture media and reagents, ensuring uninterrupted research operations.Performing related duties & responsibilities as requested.\nQualificationsMinimum QualificationsMaster’s degree in Cell Biology, Biochemistry or related area with at least 5+ years relevant experience in cell culture.Experience with transfection or transduction techniques, including immortalization.Proficiency in aseptic technique and sterile cell culture practices.Proficiency with laboratory software for database management.Strong understanding of cell biology fundamentals.Preferred QualificationsAble to identify and troubleshoot issues with cell cultures, for example, signs of abiotic stress, over trypsinization, under- or over seeding, contamination from bacteria, fungus, mycoplasma, or even other cell lines.Highly motivated, comfortable working in a results-oriented, fast paced, dynamic work environment.Excellent organizational skills with meticulous attention to detail.Effective communication and teamwork abilities, with a collaborative approach to problem-solving.\nAdditional InformationThe Rockefeller University does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity), national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service or other non-merit factor. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to the characteristics listed above.\nThe salary of the finalist selected for this role will be set based on various factors, including but not limited to organizational budgets, qualifications, experience, education, licenses, specialty, and training. The hiring range provided represents The Rockefeller University's good faith and reasonable estimate of the range of possible compensation at the time of posting.\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
