Studies are generally focused on the use of large-scale omics, automated high-throughput screening, advanced molecular biology techniques, and machine learning-based analysis to identify blood biomarkers and develop molecular diagnostics that could be used for management of acute brain injury. The research assistant will predominately support an assay development project which aims to establish a set of cell free RNA-based diagnostic tests, one for the clinical laboratory, and one for the point-of-care, that could be used to rapidly identify stroke in emergency medicine settings. The research assistant will help maintain a biorepository of human specimens and perform various molecular biology tasks such as DNA/RNA isolation, conventional/quantitative/digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and bacterial cloning as part of the larger overall project. This position will also order supplies, help maintain the laboratory space and equipment, and work to ensure/document regulatory compliance.\n\nEssential Functions\n\nMaintain inventory for a biorepository human biological specimens. Coordinate shipping and receiving of biological specimens. (10%)Carry out molecular biology tasks or experiments according to specific instructions to supply scientific information or generate materials as part of the larger project. Such functions include but are not limited to isolating nucleic acids from human biofluids to prepare samples for downstream use in experiments; measuring DNA and RNA in human biofluids using various nucleic acid amplification techniques such as quantitative PCR, digital PCR, and Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP); using conventional PCR, bacterial cloning, and in vitro transcription to generate synthetic RNA standards for use in prototype diagnostic tests. (40%)Collaborate with senior laboratory staff to make suggestions on improving techniques, methods, or procedures. Notably this includes assisting with the technical development and troubleshooting of prototype diagnostic tests. (10%) Compile and analyze data. Record results of experiments and maintain records of experiments in a detailed electronic laboratory notebook. (15%)Maintain laboratory cleanliness and maintain test equipment utilized in experiments. Document compliance with relevant State, Federal, and Institutional safety, and biosafety regulations. Order laboratory supplies and equipment. (15%)Train graduate students or new staff with respect to laboratory standard operating procedures and assist with student projects as needed. (6%)\n\n\nNonessential Funcitons\n\nPerform other duties as assigned. (4%)\n\nCONTACTS\n\nDepartment: Weekly contact with supervisor to discuss project progress. Daily contact with senior laboratory staff and other lab members to discuss projects to maintain and coordinate workflows.\n\nUniversity: Occasional contact with collaborative investigators to coordinate transfer of data or specimens.\n\nExternal: Occasional contact with vendors to exchange information.\n\nStudents: Regular contact with student employees.\n\nSUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThis position has no direct supervision of staff employees. Train graduate students or new staff with respect to laboratory standard operating procedures.\n\nQualifications\n\nEducation and experience: Bachelor's degree and 6 months of related experience or Associate's degree in an approved biotechnology program and 1 year of experience.\n\nRequired Skills\n\nStrong theoretical and experiential understanding of basic molecular biology techniques such as nucleic acid isolation, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and molecular cloning.Experience working with human biofluids preferred.Strong attention to scientific detail and technical problem-solving skills.Strong organizational skills are a must, including the ability to maintain meticulous, complete, and easily retrievable laboratory records.Ability to effectively manage time, multi-task, prioritize, and meet deadlines.Ability to maintain a clean laboratory working environment.Above average computing skills and comfort using digital laboratory systems such as remote equipment monitoring systems, electronic inventory management solutions, electronic laboratory record keeping solutions, and cloud-based data storage solutions.Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (particularly Excel) is essential. Professional and effective verbal and written communication skills, as well as good interpersonal skills, including the ability to work and communicate with various individuals within and external to the university.Must be self-motivated, and demonstrate a willingness to learn new techniques, procedures, and processes as needed.Ability to meet consistent attendance.Ability to interact with colleagues, supervisors, and customers face to face.\n\n\nWORKING CONDITIONS\n\nGeneral laboratory environment. Will work with general chemicals and human biospecimens and will need to take general laboratory and biosafety training (provided through Case Western Environmental Health and Safety office). Personal protective equipment, including lab coat, gloves, and goggles, will be provided to limit exposure to hazards.\n\nThis position is eligible for hybrid work arrangement up to two remote days per week at the discretion of the department. New employees may begin a hybrid schedule upon approval from the supervisor, successful completion of an orientation period and signing the remote work checklist certification form.\n\nIn employment, as in education, Case Western Reserve University is committed to Equal Opportunity and Diversity. Women, veterans, members of underrepresented minority groups, and individuals with disabilities are encouraged to apply.\n\nCase Western Reserve University provides reasonable accommodations to applicants with disabilities.
