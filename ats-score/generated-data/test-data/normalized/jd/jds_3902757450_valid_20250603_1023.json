When it comes to considering the costs of building and maintaining systems, you know there is more to it than parts and labor. That's why we need you, a cost analyst who can turn requirements into a complete financial understanding for the Navy.\n\nAs a cost analyst on our team, you'll translate requirements into cost through data collection, model building, and cost and risk analyses. You'll help to develop recommendations that will impact how hundreds of millions of dollars are invested throughout the project's life cycle. You'll help identify cost data to be collected, develop data collection plans, and review draft work breakdown structures (WBSs) and cost reporting plans. You will extract data about the technology and performance of submarine communications systems and undersea integration systems through discussions with SMEs, engineers, and project managers. You'll derive meaning from raw numbers using a variety of data science techniques, like normalizing data, performing statistical regression, and using learning curve analysis. From modeling with dynamic formulas in Microsoft Excel to quantifying cost uncertainty with Monte Carlo discrete event simulation, you'll use your experience in analytics and data visualization to interpret and convey meaning. By developing total ownership cost estimates, you'll help program managers, senior leadership, and your client to plan and field systems on time.
