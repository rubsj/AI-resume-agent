You will collaborate across Honeywell Aerospace engineering teams to create solutions and systems that meet the evolving needs of our customers. You will participate in all phases of product development and will be a coach and mentor to less experienced engineers.\n\nHoneywell is implementing advanced gas turbine system technologies in a number of our aircraft propulsion products and auxiliary power units. Dramatic improvements to the fidelity of simulations used in the design processes of gas turbines are essential to shorten development cycles while meeting customer requirements on these projects. You will be responsible for leading activities within the Fan and Compressor Design Systems methods group to drive continued development of predictive tools to assess mechanical behavior. As part of that effort you will also be responsible for developing software tools to automate custom workflows. You will also be expected to provide guidance to fan and compressor design teams on the use of best practices for general mechanical modeling and measurements and will develop new processes in these areas. You will help lead root cause investigations of mechanical failures to enable rapid resolution.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nDevelop and improve modeling methods and best practices for static, modal and forced response analyses in turbomachinery.Integrate static, modal, thermal and forced response analyses best practices into Honeywell design workflows with emphasis on accuracy and cycle time reductionDevelop software utilities to automate analysis workflows. Also, work with software developer teams to define and guide the development of software utilities.Guide design teams on use of best practices for mechanical modeling and measurements (linear and non-linear stress analysis, modal analysis, high-cycle fatigue)Provide leadership of root cause investigations into mechanical failures in fans and compressors and the selection of appropriate design or fabrication changes\n\nU.s.
