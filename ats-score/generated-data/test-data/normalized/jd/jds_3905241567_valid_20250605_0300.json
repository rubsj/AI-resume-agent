Your first bookmarked tab? Our hubspot self-reported attribution report - of course. You can call a key partner in the morning, listen in on a sales call before lunch, run a strategy session after eating, and finish off the day tweaking your latest landing page experiment.\nSee that person in the bathroom mirror every morning? Excellent.\nWe’re looking for a Head of Growth Marketing US (yes, you!) to make sure that as many Childcare owners and directors know that Famly is the only platform worth using to run their center.\nAnd who are Famly? We’re on a mission to close the collaboration gap in early childhood. So we’re building the world’s most collaborative Early Childhood Platform - a software platform for the adults in a young child’s life to connect, share their workload, and learn about early childhood. Basically, Famly makes life easier for educators and families so that they can get back to what matters.\nBy heading up our US Growth Marketing, you’ll be coordinating all of our key lead generating initiatives, together with a small (but mighty) team. You’ll be connecting daily with our HQ of talented EMEA growth marketers and our global brand, and content teams working out of Copenhagen, helping to define and apply our US GTM strategy. While we are current market leaders in the UK and Germany, we’re still in the early stages of our journey in the US, and so we’re also looking for somebody who likes getting tactical, and isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty - speaking with potential partners, building an understanding of the market, and running growth experiments on their own.\nWe’re looking for someone ideally based in DC (or willing to relocate - we can help with that).\n\nWhat you'll be doing:Develop the US marketing strategy to achieve our US business goals, create awareness and drive leads in the US market.Work closely with our US General Manager and CEO (both based out of DC) to bring closer collaboration between sales and marketingSupport our global Brand Director in understanding and implementing positioning and messagingRunning growth experiments to manage the funnel, create new funnels, and open up new channelsRun and allocate budgetUnderstand what makes US childcare owners and directors tickOwn our key marketing metrics for the US marketDevelop and manage marketing relationships with key industry expertsOwn the planning and execution of tradeshows, conferences, and industry events in the US.Ideate and help support campaigns together with our global brand team\n You’ll thrive in this role if you:Have 2+ years leading a marketing, growth marketing, or demand gen teamHave 5+ years working in SaaS marketing, preferably in early PMFHave proven experience in significantly increasing pipeline build Comfortable working with hubspot, GA4, Clarity, Webflow, performance marketing channel analysisHave experience creating a demand gen strategy, allocating budgets, running growth experimentsWorking closely with sales is important to you, translating their challenges into a marketing contextConsider yourself proactive - good at remembering to loop back on tasks, and spotting problems.Have a massive bias for action. You’re good at context switching, preferring to work on lots of different things at once.You happily change your mind with new information.\n{optional} And it’d be even better if you:Have been involved in either growing a new market with company at $10M ARR or growing a startup from 0-$10M ARRHave experience in education or selling tech to non-technical SMB buyersHave experience working with distributed teams, managing employees in different time zones\nWhile we’d love someone who has experience in the arena doing this type of work, we appreciate that everyone brings something unique. If you don’t tick every box above, to hell with it - apply anyway. We’d still love to read your application. \nAnd who are Famly?\nYou’re probably wondering at this stage, and Famly are...? Well, it all began when our co-founder Henrik’s daughter was ready to start at daycare. He couldn’t believe the amount of work being done on paper - and how distant he felt from his first child during the day. The paper ‘parent’ books they exchanged once a month just weren’t cutting it. Together with his friend, our co-founder and CEO Anders, they set about solving that.\nThese days, the 140 of us building Famly talk about trying to do one thing. Giving children the best possible start to life. Or rather, making it easier for the 7000 nurseries and childcare centers who use Famly every day to that, on our behalf.\nWe do it with the world’s first Early Childhood Platform, software that brings hundreds of thousands of parents closer to their child’s day while they’re away from them. We also make financial, pedagogical, and planning tools for more than 104,000 childcare professionals in the UK, US, Germany and 15 other countries, saving them hours and reducing their admin stress. \nUltimately, that gives them more time and headspace for the little ones that really matter.\nThe interview process looks like:Interview with a People PartnerLogical testInterview with our interim Head of Marketing Case assignmentPresentation of case to and interview with hiring committee consisting of Interim Head of Marketing (Also our director of Brand & Communication.)General Manager USDirector of Commercial ExcellenceDirector of People & CultureManager of Growth MarketingInterview in the DC office with CEO\n\nYou’ll love working here because:\nWe’re all about hiring clever people who are good humans too.
