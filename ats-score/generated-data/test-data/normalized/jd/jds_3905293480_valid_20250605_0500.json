You will design assays, drive innovative technologies, and lead projects using mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies to inform and streamline early-stage research and clinical discovery programs. By collaborating with chemists, biochemists, biophysicists, structural biologists, bioinformaticians, and molecular biologists, you will uncover the cellular machinery that participates in chemically-induced protein homeostasis and define the fundamental biology that drives therapeutic efficacy.\nWe look for team members who are inspired by our mission and want to work in a collaborative, rigorous, and entrepreneurial environment. We seek colleagues who are self-motivated, innovative, proactive, and possess an innate curiosity to discover novel biology and new drugs. Efficient time management, excellent organizational and communication skills, and passion for high-quality, translational science are essential.\nImpact You'll Make:Lead, design, execute, and interpret projects to study proteins and protein complexes using mass spectrometry-based proteomics approachesEstablish and lead a cutting-edge, on-site proteomics facility and grow your group by hiring and mentoring team membersDevelop and implement robust workflows for sample preparation, LC-MS-based proteomics, and quantitative data analysisCollaborate with cross-functional research teams to design and execute proteomic and other biological mass spectrometry experiments and generate high quality data to progress drug discovery and development projectsProvide or coordinate day-to-day instrument operation, maintenance, quality control and troubleshooting of Orbitrap mass spectrometers and nano-flow high performance chromatography systems (nHPLC)Serve as the scientific leader and subject matter expert (SME) in proteomics and mass spectrometry on multiple project teamsDevelop and contribute to our company's intellectual property (IP) domain by way of patents and/or publications, often as principal authorStay up-to-date with emerging scientific literature and share your ideas liberally, present and actively discuss dataCollaborate and communicate across a diverse scientific team to successfully progress Lyterian goals\nQualifications:PhD in Chemical Biology, Proteomics, Biology, Biochemistry, Biophysics or related discipline with 5+ years of relevant postdoctoral or industrial experienceExperience using mass spectrometry-based approaches to examine protein-protein interaction networks and post-translational modifications, with a proven track record of solving bioanalytical problemsExperience with chemoproteomic techniques and identification of site-specific small molecule modification of proteins using mass spectrometryExperience with quantitative proteomics, including techniques such as SILAC, SRM,TMT, label-free quantification approaches, ABPP, IP-MS, etc.Expertise with both DDA and DIA acquisition techniques and analysis of large scale proteomics data using commercial and open-source software tools (Proteome Discoverer, Skyline, MaxQuant, etcâ€¦)In-depth knowledge and demonstrated proficiency in operating nano LC-MS and Orbitrap-based MS systems is requiredDevelop and execute high-throughput proteomic characterization assays for recombinant and endogenous proteins, including intact mass analysis. Experience with affinity selection mass spectrometry (ASMS) screening technologies is a plus.Knowledge of protein degradation mechanisms and in particular the biochemistry of ubiquitin ligasesEvidence of scientific excellence and impact as illustrated by scientific publications and presentationsInitiative and boldness to dive into a fast-paced new startup\n$150,000 - $190,000 a year\nWe encourage candidates of all levels to apply as there is often flexibility on job title and responsibilities. Compensation will be based on a variety of factors, including experience, qualifications, internal equity and location. Lyterian offers a competitive employment package that includes an annual bonus, significant equity, and a generous benefits package including comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for our employees and their families, plus a 401K match.\nAt Lyterian, we believe that a diverse, open, and inclusive environment and culture is key to our success.
