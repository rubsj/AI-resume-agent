We invest in businesses that have a tremendous record of accomplishment, but most investors ignore it. When we partner with small service-based businesses of individual real estate agents, we invest heavily into their businesses to them significantly grow their clientele and scale business profits. We consider ourselves as a “Partnership as a Service” business similar to, but different than, a SaaS business. Fusion was recently ranked as the 813th fastest-growing business by Inc. 5000. Therefore, we consider this role to be one of the best opportunities for sales professional business advisors available today.\nOur partners benefit from Fusion providing their business with sophisticated growth planning, a full suite of back-office services and SaaS resources, plus the support of our experienced staff. Fusion is the only company in the country that currently offers these services and is compensated in a way that conveniently accommodates the cash flow challenges of a real estate agent. We have over 300 team members and are growing very quickly. We need more talent to enter untouched markets.\nFusion invests in companies through strategic revenue-sharing growth partnerships. Our investment resources include, but are not limited to, thousands of dollars of business building systems and processes and the staff to operate those business systems which are all provided as an investment into our partners' businesses. Fusion’s income is primarily generated from a small share of the revenue generated by our partner’s businesses. Our company is looking to hire additional Partnership Development Executives to support our rapidly growing volume of new partnership investments.\nJob descriptionA Partnership Development Executive functions as the business advisor to influence revenue and transaction volume growth for Fusion’s business investment partnerships. A successful candidate will provide Fusion’s partners with attentive support and business coaching to dramatically expand their business profitability.\nThe income potential of this commission-based, revenue-sharing, position is typically $70,000 annually starting out. As a Partnership Development Executive’s “book of business” grows, they can realistically earn $250,000 annually or more, within the first two years. We are only looking for amazing talented individuals who can help us grow and represent Fusion at the highest levels of professionalism.\nThe two main responsibilities of this position are (1) business development of investment acquisitions and (2) managing partnership relationships as Fusion’s business advisor.\nThe purpose of our Partnership Development Executive is to “build” a book of business of high-quality partners and then to be fanatically obsessed with the success and business growth of each one of the partners you serve. The Partnership Development Executive, as an executive, is responsible for the partner's experience and business success in partnership with Fusion. Fusion provides a team of individuals to work on the client’s behalf, but the PDE must push for success. Real estate agents and other small businesses join us for the purpose of scaling their businesses and it is the job of PDE to make sure that happens.\nA Partnership Development Executive’s Two Main Functions Investment / Partner Acquisition: The Partnership Development Executive’s purpose is to qualify potential business candidates, and provide a detailed explanation of investment to potential partners. If the partner candidate has a high desire to engage in partnership with Fusion, then the Partner Development Executive helps structure the “deal.” It is a little bit like Shark Tank, but quite different as well. It is our practice to present our services personally to a potential partner to ensure full comprehension and interaction with that partner.Business Advisor: When we invest in one of these small businesses, part of your job is to function like a “board member” or trusted advisor to the business owner to encourage best practices and to fully adoption of our systems to ensure the likelihood of their success.\nSuccessful candidates for this position will be trained extensively on our go-to-market strategy, business philosophies, and systems/processes. We provide a very specific process and system unique in the business world.For the benefit of those who are reading this ad, you can view an example of the presentation we provide for Real Estate Agents at:https://www.succeedwithfusion.com/fusion-partnership-in-detail-videosand you can view the rest of our website at: https://www.fusiongrowthpartners.net\nOur Ideal CandidateOur ideal candidate is a polished professional with highly effective communication skills, who is very persuasive but not “salesy,” does not shy away from difficult conversations, and attacks problems or issues head-on. A successful candidate must be able to present ideas and concepts with confidence and assurance. That candidate must be able to work with very strong-willed people and be able to show them Fusion’s unique perspective, which they will embrace over time.
