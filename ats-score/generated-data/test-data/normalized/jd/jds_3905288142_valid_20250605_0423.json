They act as the binding element between product development and manufacturing engineering, ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of this critical interface. They support Product Development in the optimization of designs and piece parts for manufacturability by realizing sample tooling/products/prototypes. They also design, develop, and qualify tooling and processes to meet TE quality and production standards, document all processes and tooling in applicable TE systems, support supply chain to verify supplier compliance and capability, initiate and implement programs to continuously improve quality, cost and cycle time and adhere to all appropriate specifications, regulatory requirements and customer requirements.\nThe Aerospace, Defense and Marine (AD&M) business unit of TE is part of the Industrial Solutions segment and is a world leader in the design of components and electrical interconnection solutions that are used for applications in extreme and rigorous environments. These interconnection solutions make possible applications of avionics, jet and propulsion engine management, flight controls, grounding systems and onboard entertainment (EAB) for today's \"connected aircraft\". This capability is extended to military, marine, aviation, space, land, and drone vehicles, as well as oil and gas exploration of open-ocean deposits. TE offers solutions for enhanced connectivity that work and resist in the most extreme environments on Earth, from the deepest oceans to the ends of space.\nWe are currently seeking a highly motivated Staff Manufacturing and Process Development Engineer to join our Advanced Manufacturing Development Team. TE Connectivity's Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Teams are process leaders for stamping, molding, or assembly related topics, ensuring the processes are running at optimum levels for quality and output. They are experts in mold tooling, die tooling, machining, and assembly techniques, possessing extensive knowledge of the associated manufacturing processes which may include the optimization and standardization of stamping / molding / assembly or other processes within the manufacturing environment. Manufacturing Engineering Teams enable the TE business unit plants to reach TE Operating Advantage (TEOA) requirements, roll out Centers of Excellence (COE), Best Demonstrated Practices (BDP’s) and advise plants on tool and machine duplications / corrections / improvements. They design and develop manufacturing process and automation platforms and apply them for the realization of new product developments as well as optimization of existing products already in production. The Teams also support Product Development in the selection and optimization of tools for piece part production and the selection of the most suitable manufacturing concepts relative to planned manufacturing quantities, quality requirements and manufacturing location. They act as interface between engineering and production to ensure manufacturability of new designs and smooth production ramp up as well as support the research & development teams to produce sample manufacturing equipment, product samples and prototypes.\nWhat you will be doing...Applying extensive knowledge to the design, build, and procurement of mold tooling to meet TE quality and production standards.Assisting with the identification and implementation of new molding technologies into our global footprint.Serving as technical resource for consulting on complex internal / external mold processing, tooling, resin, quality, and capacity concerns. Supporting and coordinating TE Best and Molding COE activities as well as recommending and implementing best practices across all the facilitiesUsing data driven analytical problem-solving techniques such Six Sigma, DMAIC, 8D, etc. to find root cause of molding problems with recommended solutions, driving improved process capability.Supporting the deployment of Molding Excellence and TEOA foundations in the ADM molding environment.Working with Supply Chain and Procurement teams on sourcing molded components and supporting external supply base as necessary.Collaborating with Product Development Engineering to ensure designs meet cost objectives and are driven by design for manufacturability principles.Providing molding expertise to several assigned New Product Development projects while ensuring key deliverables are met per project schedules, including the transfer of the molds to production.Documenting all processes and tooling in applicable TE systems.Participating and leading FMEA reviews around molding.\nQualificationsDue to ITAR regulations, US citizenship or US lawful permanent residency (green card) is required to apply for this position. Bachelor’s degree in Molding Engineering, Polymer Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering or equivalent with specialized experience in molding processes. Advanced degree a plus.Minimum of 8 years’ experience working within the molding discipline or environment. Advanced knowledge of mold processing and tooling designs for thermoplastics, thermosets and silicones are required. Knowledge and experience in processing engineered resins is a plus.Ability to utilize Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Moldflow software to support mold/tooling design reviewsExperience working in a low volume, high mix environment is preferred. Experience with molding of military/aerospace products is a plus. Demonstrated ability to work within a cross-functional team.Excellent oral and written communication skills with the ability to communicate across all levels within and outside of the organization. GB or BB in Lean Design for Six Sigma preferred but not required.Capability to work in a fasted paced, dynamic global environment with multiple changing priorities.Proficient in MS Office Software such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. Knowledge in statistical software packages such as JMP and Minitab desirable but not required.Sound project management skills.Ability to travel globally 25%-50% of the time.\nPlease note: This position may involve working with technical data, technology, software/source code, hardware or other items (collectively “items) subject to U.S. and non-U.S. export control laws and regulations. Under these regulations, it may be necessary for TE to verify a candidate’s national origin and/or citizenship status to find whether a U.S. or other government export license is required prior to releasing its technologies to the candidate. If TE finds that TE will require a license or will be prohibited by applicable laws from providing the candidate with items necessary for the performance of this position, then TE expressly reserves the right to either a) make an offer of employment contingent upon TE receiving required export licenses from the appropriate government agency, b) consider the candidate for a different position that is not subject to such restrictions, on whatever terms and conditions TE shall establish in its sole discretion, or c) decline to move forward with the candidate’s application. \nAt TE, we believe in unleashing people’s potential. We have Employee Resource Groups (Women In Networking ALIGN – LGBTQ, Young Professionals, etc.) to support and promote a diverse workplace and a culture of inclusion for the development of different perspectives, styles, and ideas. By doing this, we are consistently recognized by Thomson Reuters, and now Clarivate Analytics, as one of the Top 100 Innovators, as well as deemed one of the world’s most ethical companies by Ethisphere.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Associate",
