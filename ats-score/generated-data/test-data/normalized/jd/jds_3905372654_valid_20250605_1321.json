Experience with designing for AI products. \n\n You might be a great fit if... \n\n You are passionate about design and early-stage venture work - connecting dots, being 'wrong' more than you're 'right,' getting your hands dirty, and embracing ambiguity.  You don't attach your worth to an idea or design. The vast majority of early-stage ideas we come up with will fail - we're a team that tests, iterates, and makes the tough calls. If you're prone to falling in love with an early design, you may find our environment challenging. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer/minority/female/disability/protected veteran.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Entry level",
