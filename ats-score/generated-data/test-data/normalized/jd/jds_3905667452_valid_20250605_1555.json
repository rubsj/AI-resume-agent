The application process involves uploading your resume and answering a few brief questions about your experience, skills, and suitability for the role. This straightforward application process should take less than 15 minutes to complete.\n\nStep 2: One-Way Video Interview - If your application demonstrates a strong alignment with the role's requirements, you'll be invited to participate in a One-Way Video Interview. This is your moment to introduce yourself, highlight your skills and provide context about your professional experience. You'll be asked 3-4 questions and will have 3 attempts to record the answer that best reflects who you are as a candidate. We'll send you a link to the interview in your invitation email, and you can record it at your convenience using your smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer with a webcam. Once you've completed recording your one-way video interview, we'll provide an update to your candidacy within seven days or sooner.\n\nStep 3: Job Fit Interview - If during the One-Way Video Interview we confirm that your background seems well-aligned for the role a team member will schedule 30 minutes for you to chat with the hiring manager. Here you'll be asked questions that give you space to talk about any relevant experience you have for the role.\n\nDuring this interview you’ll also have time to ask the hiring manager any questions you have to evaluate whether Bizee matches the values and opportunities you want in your next company.\n\nA team member will follow up with you within seven days after the job fit interview to provide you with an update on whether you’re moving to the next step in the hiring process.\n\nStep 4: Skills Interview & Project - After talking with the hiring manager, you'll do a skills interview with a member of the hiring team. This is a practical evaluation to see if you have the relevant skills to succeed in the role.

If your specific role requires a project you’ll be compensated for it and will be given details surrounding the project from the hiring manager.\n\nStep 5: Final Decision - After the final interview, we evaluate each candidate who made it to this stage, and the hiring team makes a decision. If no candidates meet the hiring bar, we interview additional candidates starting at step two. When it comes to hiring, we’re willing to wait for a great match. In practice, this means that if you receive an offer from Bizee, we think you meet all core qualifications, align with our values, and would be a tremendous addition to the team.\n\nStep 6: Reference and Background Checks - We run all of our background checks via certified third parties.\n\nWe promise that we will never reach out to your current employer without your permission. If multiple candidates meet our hiring bar, we may ask for references from 2-3 candidates to help us make our decision.\n\nIn some cases, we may request references while scheduling the final interview to help us with moving the process as quickly as possible. While we may request references before the offer stage, they will always be optional until after your final interview, when we’re ready to move toward the offer stage.\n\nStep 7: Offer - Once background & reference checks are complete, we'll make an offer to you including details about salary, benefits, and other relevant details. Your offer will be determined by the salary range for the role, your relevant experience, and the skills you demonstrate during the hiring process.\n\nWe aim to make a competitive offer the first time around.
