Do you have the business savvy, SAP background, and sales skills necessary to help position AWS as the cloud provider of choice for customers? Do you love building new strategic and data-driven businesses? Join AWS’ Specialist Sales team as an Area Specialist!\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is proud to be the pioneer and widely recognized leader in Cloud Computing. Our web services provide IT infrastructure in-the-cloud that is used by hundreds of thousands of developers and businesses around the world. These customers range from start-ups to leading web companies to Global 500 companies in industries such as financial services, pharmaceuticals, and high technology.\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\nThe Area Specialist Team is made up of deep domain experts who work directly with our customers to solve their most complex challenges. We are part of the Account Team, responsible for account planning, opportunity identification, and pursuit. We stay closely connected to our customers and bring valuable data and insights to our product teams, strengthening the product roadmap. Our team is at its best when a customer is thinking big and needs specialized experience to innovate for their business.\n\nAWS and SAP have been collaborating since SAP became a customer in 2008. Together, we have certified AWS to support most SAP solutions, brought purpose built EC2 instances to market to support SAP customer needs, and helped SAP leverage AWS services to power a number of their SaaS and PaaS offerings like Concur, SuccessFactors (for government agencies), HANA Cloud Platform, Signavio and SAP Analytics Cloud. AWS has been supporting SAP workloads for customers longer than any other cloud provider (since 2011), and thousands of customers run their SAP ERP and adjacent business-critical systems on AWS today using RISE, traditional perpetual license, and hybrid deployment models. SAP runs more SAP BTP Services on AWS than any other Cloud Services Provider. Customers can modernize their SAP systems using 200+ AWS cloud native services and 80+ SAP BTP services running on AWS, including offerings for data lakes, AI/ML, GenAI, image recognition, chat-bots, and more.\n\nThe SAP on AWS team engages SAP enterprise applications customers through two routes to market (RTM): the AWS field and the AWS partner ecosystem.\n\nWe are seeking a sales professional to extend our customer relationships focused on SAP on AWS. This person will contribute to the overall performance of the business globally measured by revenue growth, net new customer wins, SAP migrations, and reference wins. You will have a specialist sales role within a matrixed sales organization and will build a strategy focused on winning new customer segments and growing existing customer segments for the long term. As a self-starter willing to operate in a multifaceted way, you should also have experience in market development of cloud infrastructure and/or enterprise applications.\n\nThe role will require working with the partner ecosystem to help secure joint customers for new use cases, execute go-to-market programs, and further develop partnerships.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nDiverse Experiences\n\nAmazon values diverse experiences.

Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is\n\nwhy we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home,\n\nthere’s nothing we can’t achieve in the cloud.\n\nInclusive Team Culture\n\nHere at AWS, it’s in our nature to learn and be curious.
