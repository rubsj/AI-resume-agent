Calico will use that knowledge to devise interventions that enable people to lead longer and healthier lives. Calico’s highly innovative technology labs, its commitment to curiosity-driven discovery science, and, with academic and industry partners, its vibrant drug-development pipeline, together create an inspiring and exciting place to catalyze and enable medical breakthroughs.\n\nPosition Overview\n\nThere are now many ways to slow aging and extend lifespan in model organisms, including mammals, and Calico seeks an experienced research scientist to validate potential aging targets for entry into our translational drug-development pipeline. The investigator will work with Cynthia Kenyon’s team to identify potential targets and to validate them experimentally (at the bench, through CROs, and by leading highly-collaborative cross-functional teams using state-of-the art technology at Calico and externally). The candidate should have a good working knowledge of molecular genetic regulatory pathways, cell biology, mouse biology and be eager and able to follow the science wherever it leads. Strong computational data-analysis skills are a must. The candidate should have a thirst for knowledge and the desire and ability to master the relevant literature. He or she should have excellent organizational and leadership skills, generosity of spirit, and a passion for slowing aging in humans.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\nIdentify and validate translational targets for agingRigorously evaluate the case that perturbing the target is likely to slow all or part of aging and extend human health spanIdentify and evaluate potential disease indications Evaluate the target from the perspective of safety, freedom to operate, competitive landscape, regulatory feasibility and draggability (using chemical, biologic or genetic interventions)Master and follow the relevant biological field and incorporate new findings into your validation strategy At the bench and leading cross-functional teams, design and execute target validation experiments that would justify a focused drug development effortAnalyze experimental data rigorously and critically, and modify your strategy as appropriateProject Leadership:Provide effective and inspirational leadership for cross-functional project teamsProvide project management required to ensure successful executionTerminate projects and move on when appropriateCollaboration:Contribute to Calico’s collaborative and innovative research environmentCollaborate with internal and external partners, including academic institutions and industry collaborators, to best advance the research sciencePublication and PresentationsContribute to impactful publications and scientific presentations, both internally and externally\nQualifications\n\nPhD or MD-PhDExcellent analytical skills and a creative and curious mindProven track record of high-quality laboratory research and publicationsStrong working knowledge of genetics, cell biology, molecular genetics and physiologyExcellent computational skillsEffective speaker and writerStrong technical skills at the benchExcellent leadership skills and the ability to lead and collaborate with cross-functional teams and external partners.Hands-on drug development experience is desirable but not required.Must be willing to work onsite at least four days per week\n\nThe estimated base salary range for this role is $146,000 - $155,000. Actual pay will be based on a number of factors including experience and qualifications. This position is also eligible for two annual cash bonuses.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
