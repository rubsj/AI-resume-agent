These were spurred by a small group of people rigorously focused on building technology to achieve faster access to more of the world. We seek to usher in a new era of humanity defined by universal access to the whole globe free of borders and the presence of a routine way from space to Earth. To do this, we are building highly maneuverable re-entry vehicles that can loiter in orbit before precision landing back on Earth.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nOur simulation engineer will be responsible for architecting and building the structure and content for Inversion ’ s integrated vehicle simulation and HITL framework . You will be creating simulation models for vehicle dynamics from orbit, through the atmosphere, to landing under parachute. You will also design and build the interface structure between GNC and FSW that allows GNC algorithms to be easily tested in a GNC simulation environment and deployed into FSW in the form of HITL and flight code. You will be architecting a simulation framework that allows GNC to readily develop algorithms and models . The system you build and the degree to which it is done elegantly and intelligently will have major effects on how every GNC, test, and FSW engineer designs Inversion ’ s spacecraft.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\n Performed development of a simulation environment, implemented GNC in flight software, developed GNC to HITL interface .  Experience with MATLAB and C/C++  Strong skills in dynamics , modeling of physical systems and six- degree- of-freedom simulation  Experience with Monte Carlo simulation s .  Experience working with a complicated and multidisciplinary air or space vehicle  Experienced the full life cycle of development to deployment for a flight vehicle or across multiple vehicles.  4+ years of applicable experience  Minimum of bachelor’s degree in computer science , physics, aerospace, mechanical, electrical engineering.  Proven ability to work effectively in a fast -paced environment . D emonstrated excellent v erbal and written communication skills. \n\nDesired Qualifications\n\nCompleted master’s degree or higher educationExperience with verification and validation of GNCStrong software design skillsExperience with reentry vehiclesExperience with Julia programming languageExperience with spacecraft specific sensors and actuatorsExperience with orbital mechanics, aerodynamics, and multi-body dynamicsExperience with developing GNC algorithms\n\nThe California annual base salary for this role is currently  $110,000 - $160,000  .  Pay Grades are determined by role, level, location, and alignment with market data.  Individual pay will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: interviews and an assessment of several factors that are unique to each candidate, job-related skills, relevant education and experience, certifications, abilities of the candidate and internal equity. \n\nITAR Compliance\n\nTo conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State. Learn more about the ITAR here .\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\nInversion provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran status, or disability.\n\nInversion collects and processes personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
