The core job of this position is to develop and perform functional assays to support large molecule drug discovery, especially in immunology and oncology. Successful candidate will establish a process to test lead therapeutic molecules for functional activities related to T cells, macrophages, or other key cells in the tumor microenvironment. You will interface with project leaders, contribute to the assessment of the projects’ needs for target characterization and relevant assay formats, and conduct experiments in a fast-paced environment. This position demands a good understanding of the biological challenges facing multiple therapeutic areas as well as technical proficiency in the latest methodologies.\n\nPrimary responsibilities:\n\n Co-ordinate and perform experiments to assess functional activities of lead molecules relating to T cells, myeloid cells, tumor cells, stromal cells or other key cell types.  Co-ordinate and perform experiments to validate new targets and drug concepts. Common techniques include primary cell isolation and culture, flow cytometry, ELISA, MSD, tumor cell cytotoxicity, immune cell isolation from whole blood or tissues, reporter assays, high-content or Incucyte-based imaging and Western blot.  Analyze and present data in professional publication-ready format. Keep up-to-date with the literature in field  Working under limited supervision with a high level of autonomy\n\nQualifications:\n\nRequirements\n\nMaster’s degree in Life Sciences (Immunology, Oncology, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, or a related field) with 6 years of experience OR Bachelor’s degree with 9 years of relevant experience is required.Multi-color flow cytometry experience is required.Experience in functional assays related to human immune cells is required.
