We run millions of customer clusters, enabling processing on vast datasets. In the last 3 years we have improved our engines by a factor of 5x by making changes to the optimizer, query runtime, and storage connectors. We have also made significant changes to the compiler to enable enterprise features like fine-grained access control. This is a “must-win” strategic area in a growing and very technical space.\n\nWe are looking for to help us improve the engine further. We are looking to make deeper changes all around the query engine codebase.\n\nThe Spark Performance - Alternative Accelerations team is looking for a skilled engineer to help in our mission to provide the world’s fastest and easiest-to-use cloud Big Data processing platform. We develop the AWS Runtime for Spark, which is 100% API compatible with Apache Spark and is designed to run with superior performance and scalability on customer-managed EC2 clusters, EKS clusters, and in serverless environments. As an engineer in this space, you will enable Spark users across AWS services (e.g., EMR, Athena, Glue) to benefit from the AWS Runtime for Spark. You will apply and extend our automated statistical analysis tools to identify, design, and deliver optimizations further improving the AWS Runtime for Spark’s performance and its interaction with other AWS technologies, reviewing your work with a strong group of Senior and Principal Engineers. You will ensure that your optimizations can be delivered to all AWS Spark customers and allow them to benefit from them with minimal configuration - preferably none.\n\nTo learn more about Athena, EMR, and the Spark Performance team’s work:\n\n AWS Athena: https://aws.amazon.com/athena AWS EMR: http://aws.amazon.com/emr AWS Big Data Blog: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/ EMR/EKS widens performance gap: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/amazon-emr-on-eks-widens-the-performance-gap-run-apache-spark-workloads-5-37-times-faster-and-at-4-3-times-lower-cost/\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\n Hands-on development for core components of the query engine Design and develop solutions and algorithms to improve the performance of Spark Design and develop improvements to the AWS Runtime for Spark’s integration with other AWS services Manage complex deliverables project and research projects with deadlines Ensure data consistency and durability with breakthrough performance and scalability.
