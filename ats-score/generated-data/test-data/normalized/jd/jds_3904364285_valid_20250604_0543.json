We enable the rest of engineering to move faster by making those domains simple and easy to use. Our current focus is on rethinking existing APIs to meet the changing needs of the business. Looking forward, the goal is to provide a platform, tools, and help to enable other teams to build great, simple APIs of their own.\n\nThink about the best products you’ve built as an engineer. Were they powered by APIs that did what you needed so you could focus on solving your user problem? Did these APIs just make sense and work as expected? If so, you already know what we’re trying to do. Building production software is hard. Making it so simple to use that it disappears into the background is harder. Doing that for healthcare data, which can be messy, is so hard that nobody has really done it.\n\nThis Team Could Be Right For You If\n\nYou get excited by high-impact work that is foundational to the operation of the businessYou know that a big part of solving a complex business problem is getting the domain model rightWhere others see complexity, you see simpler subproblems and solutions that can be built back up to solve the broader problem\n\nResponsibilities\n\nAchieve team and business impact through high personal outputPrioritize and scope engineering effort according to expected business value, effectively communicating with teammates and stakeholdersDirect project execution by managing epics/stories/tasks, providing clarity to the business on delivery timing, and acting as an owner of overall project successDesign, implement, test, and operate systems with exemplary engineering fundamentals that make appropriate tradeoffsEngage in cross-team and cross-functional efforts to ensure timely, successful delivery against team OKRsMentor engineers, improving their technical and non-technical skills to maximize their impact\n\nQualifications\n\nStellar engineering leadership by example — regardless of your language of choice, you separate concerns and define well-abstracted interfaces, leading to functioning, performant, well-tested, maintainable code and systemsThinking and communicating in first principles — you are able to explain your points of view from foundational concepts rather than by associative thinkingCritical thinking with influence — you systematically evaluate the tradeoffs associated with each potential solution to a problem, make an informed conclusion, and articulate these things well to influence others, driving impact\n\nThe United States new hire base salary target ranges for this full-time position are:\n\nZone A: $156,200 - $232,400 + equity + benefits\n\nZone B: $130,200 - $193,650 + equity + benefits\n\nThis range reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for candidates based on their respective Zone.
