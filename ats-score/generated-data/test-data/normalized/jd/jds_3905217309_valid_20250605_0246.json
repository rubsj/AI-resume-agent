Leveraging your deep understanding of utilities-specific technologies and best practices, you will collaborate with cross-functional teams to architect and implement comprehensive solutions that enable a secure, highly resilient and scalable field area networks. Key areas of focus include:and design of wireless field area networks (private LTE, public 4G/5G infrastructure) and optical wide area network (WAN) solutions such as MPLS);network studies for RF networks (Mesh IP or Point-Multipoint) and private LTE networks;engineering of wireless field area networks based on the anticipated workload and applications for a modern utility;the transition from heterogenous, proprietary, application specific FANs to a multipurpose, 3GPP-compliant field area network that is cloud ready (or native); andof use cases, business capabilities models, reference architecture, secure engineering practices, business case, roadmaps and RFX procurementsUtilities are dependent on field area networks for operation of their distribution networks and control systems (substations, transformers, pumping stations, pipelines, distribution feeders, etc.), integration of distributed energy resources (DER) and support of new applications (leak detection, pressure monitoring, EV charging, etc.). Key ResponsibilitiesLead the end-to-end solution architecture design process, taking into account both functional and non-functional requirements specific to field area networks for utilities applications. Collaborate closely with stakeholders, including business leaders, development teams, and third-party vendors, to understand business objectives and translate them into technical solutions. Develop architectural designs, documentation, and technical specifications that adhere to industry standards, regulatory compliance, and security protocols within the utilities landscape. Evaluate existing systems and recommend enhancements or new solutions to improve performance, reliability, and efficiency within the utilities domain. Provide guidance and support to development teams during the implementation phase, ensuring alignment with architectural principles and best practices. Stay updated on emerging technologies, trends, and innovations in the utilities sector, integrating relevant advancements into solution designs. Act as a subject matter expert, offering insights and recommendations on technological advancements and their potential impact on the utilities industry. RequirementsBachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Network Architecture/Engineering or related field. Proven experience (10+ years) as a Network Architect, demonstrating successful delivery of complex projects. Experience in the utilities industry or with wireless providers is preferred.Proficiency in architectural frameworks (examples – certifications on TOGAF, Cisco, AWS and Azure).Strong understanding of relevant standards for wireless networks (3GPP, NERC CIP, NIST frameworks, etc.)Excellent communication skills with the ability to articulate complex technical concepts to business and technical audiences. Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, with a strategic mindset to drive innovative solutions. Experience collaborating with cross-functional teams in an agile environment.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
