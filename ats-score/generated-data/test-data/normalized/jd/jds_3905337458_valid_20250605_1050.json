When our founders met at a sunny California diner, they came up with an idea to revolutionize the enterprise software market. And when we began to rise, one thing that really set us apart was our culture. A culture which was driven by our value of putting our people first. And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are. Our Workmates believe a healthy employee-centric, collaborative culture is the essential mix of ingredients for success in business. That’s why we look after our people, communities and the planet while still being profitable. Feel encouraged to shine, however that manifests: you don’t need to hide who you are. You can feel the energy and the passion, it's what makes us unique. Inspired to make a brighter work day for all and transform with us to the next stage of our growth journey? Bring your brightest version of you and have a brighter work day here.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nAre you passionate about keeping millions of customers’ data safe?

As a part of this team, you will help build and support enterprise grade security tools and services for the Security Products initiatives.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nThis role’s charter is to develop, build, deploy, and support the security specific solutions and infrastructure to help protect Workday customers data. We have a hybrid schedule where you will have the opportunity to collaborate with Workmates at the office but still have the flexibility to work up to 50% remote.\n\nThe successful candidate will have a proven potential to work in a production focused diverse organization. You will be working in a rapidly moving microservices environment where resilience and scalability are key non-functional requirements. This will require you to work efficiently within your own team but also to coordinate with others in teams both locally and in other timezones. Also this role will require the operation and maintenance of our critical production system as well as building massively scalable digital security systems as part of that is core to all Workday services.\n\nAbout You\n\nBasic Qualifications\n\n5+ years software development or DevOps experienceExperience automating infrastructure in at least one modern programming language such as Python, Go, Ruby, JavaExperience with internet protocols TCP/IP, HTTP, SSL/TLS etcExperience with Linux and container technologies (K8s, Docker)Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field (or equivalent experience)\n\nOther Qualifications\n\nExperience with public cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure)Experience running databases (SQL and NoSQL)Knowledge and experience working with cryptographic, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or key management systems such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)Experience of full life-cycle software engineering practices including coding standards, testing, code reviews, source control management, and operationsExcellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to convey technical information to a wide variety of audiencesExcellent problem solving skills\n\nWorkday Pay Transparency Statement\n\nThe annualized base salary ranges for the primary location and any additional locations are listed below. Workday pay ranges vary based on work location. As a part of the total compensation package, this role may be eligible for the Workday Bonus Plan or a role-specific commission/bonus, as well as annual refresh stock grants.

Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote \"home office\" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.\n\nPursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nWorkday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.\n\nAre you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
