We combine modern DNA sequencing and machine learning technology with breakthrough research on the forest microbiome to put the right native, biodiverse communities of mycorrhizal fungi in the right place. This leads to more quality wood created more quickly, more carbon sequestered, and more resilient forests. We serve land partners seeking to implement regenerative forestry practices that improve productivity and sustainability, and corporate carbon buyers building high-quality carbon removal portfolios with strong social and biodiversity outcomes. We're a team of passionate scientists and builders on a mission to draw down at least three gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2050.\nIf you are excited by starting new things, learning as you go, and being hands-on in applying your work to the private sector, you will dig working with us. We encourage you to apply even if only some of the below criteria are met - just make sure to tell us why you’re excited about Funga!\nAbout the RoleYears of research and in-field trials have gone into developing this powerful technology for improving the health and performance of forestry projects, which are vital to addressing many of our current crises. We are in the middle of a climate crisis, and Funga can pull down tens-of-millions of tons of additional CO2e every year. We are in a global shortage of timber and building materials, and Funga can accelerate the delivery of board-feet in a way that improves managed forest ecologies, rather than destroys them. The current biodiversity crisis has roots underground where sub-soil ecologies have been destroyed and homogenized.\nFunga aims to catalog and restore foundational soil biodiversity. Global businesses and governments need high-quality carbon removal solutions to enable emissions reduction and attainment of net zero goals. Funga is building a new class of sustainable, high-quality carbon removal with the potential to achieve enormous scale in the next five to ten years.\nDelivering on this potential requires translating complex science and technology into meaningful business outcomes.
