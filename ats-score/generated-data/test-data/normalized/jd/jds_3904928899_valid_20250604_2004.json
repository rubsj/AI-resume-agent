In business for 25 years, we place quality at the heart of all that we do. Clients include: AdTech companies, Digital Publishers, Digital divisions of Media Companies, SaaS (Software as a Service) / Enterprise, Programmatic... Sell Side Platforms (SSP), Ad Exchanges, Demand Side Platforms (DSP), Marketing Technology companies, Ad Agencies, Data Providers, Aggregators, & DMP’s, Video, Social, Mobile companies, Behavioral Targeting companies, Media Buying Platforms, Lead Generation/Co-Registration companies, Ad Serving Platforms, Rich Media companies.\nRequired Notification: Certain states require that job postings indicate a minimum and maximum base salary in an effort to not discriminate – a very worthwhile purpose that Media Recruiting Group supports. MRG’s practices are and have always been non-discriminatory, and jobs are open to all candidates with respect to race, color, religion, national origin, military status, sexual orientation, sex/gender, age, national origin, disability, etc. That said, companies require that we supply them with candidates with very specific experience, and the commensurate compensation for every job varies. It is a function of a person’s years of experience, type of experience, skills, knowledge of certain computer programs, etc. And every job may have a unique requirement. And every job could come in higher or lower than the range we are given. We do not control the upper and lower ranges for our clients, so we make a best efforts attempt to include information requested by said states. In the case of sales people, most time it is also a function of their contacts. If the job is an analyst, analytical skills and experience matter. Etc. This makes stating a reasonable minimum and maximum challenging absent all of this information about a given candidate. Companies also have other elements of compensation, including but not limited to, commission, bonus, equity, profit sharing, varying levels of healthcare coverage and how much a person would have to contribute to the premium, various perks like continuing education, commuter reimbursement, phone reimbursement, etc. – not included in “salary” as the law states. Thus, know that anything we note in a salary range does NOT include such other compensation elements. And, as recruiters, we don’t know what all of those elements are, as we are recruiting for a company, not for ourselves, and they do not brief us as to each benefit. We are a 3rd party and can only estimate to the best of our knowledge, and thus offer the minimum and maximum salary MRG in good faith believes at the time of the posting the client is willing to pay for the advertised job.\nQualified by all of the above, for this job with requisite/required years of the required experience and skills, the minimum and maximum salary is approximated at is hourly $22-24/hour, which is equivalent to approx..40,000 - $50,000 per year respectfully, exclusive of commission, bonus, equity, profit sharing, any element of healthcare coverage, any reference to how much a person would have to contribute to the premium of a healthcare plan, any perks, or other forms of compensation. Fewer years of experience could bring the base salary lower, and more experience could bring the base salary higher, if the company is willing to increase their salary bands.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
