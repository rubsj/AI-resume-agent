Are you passionate about helping customers build solutions leveraging the state-of-the-art AI/ML/GenAI tools on Amazon Web Service (AWS)? Come join us!\n\nAt Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience in our products are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.\n\nWithin AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists, and, 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Lex, Amazon Kendra, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Rekognition to quickly add intelligence to applications with simple API calls.\n\nAWS is looking for a Machine Learning Solutions Architect (ML SA), who will be the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for helping customers in the AMERICAS design solutions that leverage our GenAI services, including Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon Q. As part of the team, you will work closely with customers to enable large-scale use cases, design GenAI pipelines, and drive the adoption of AWS for the AI/ML platforms. You will interact with other SAs in the field, providing guidance on their customer engagements, and you will develop white papers, blogs, reference implementations, and presentations to enable customers to fully leverage GenAI on AWS. Additionally, as the voice of the customer, you will work closely with the service teams, and submit product feature requests to drive the platform forward.\n\nYou must have deep technical experience working with technologies related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and/or deep learning. A strong mathematics and statistics background is preferred in addition to experience building complex machine learning models. You will be familiar with the ecosystem of software vendors in the GenAI space, and will leverage this knowledge to help AWS customers in their selection process.\n\nTravel up to 50% across the AMERICAs may be possible.\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\n Working with customers’ development and data science teams to deeply understand their business and technical needs. After understanding their needs, you will design solutions that make the best use of the AWS cloud platform and AWS AI/ML Services including SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Lex, Amazon Personalize, and the other AI/ML services. Partner with SAs, Sales, Business Development and the AI/ML Service teams to accelerate customer adoption and revenue attainment in the AMERICAS for Amazon SageMaker and related services that support GenAI use cases.
