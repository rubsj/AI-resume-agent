In collaboration with the Director of Construction and appropriate University departments, define and manage the project scope, budget, schedule, and administer the contract documents prepared by design professionals. Projects primarily involve a scope which focuses on electrical, mechanical, HVAC, plumbing, telecommunications, fire prevention, and security systems. Of equal importance are architectural details, finishes, furniture, fixture, and equipment installation.\n\nSpecific objectives include determining project delivery methods, creating initial project budgets, developing Requests for Proposal (RFPs), reviewing design and construction documents developed by consultants, and coordinating communication with internal constituencies, consultants, and vendors. Facilitates collaboration between various university departments including Planning & Design, Business & Finance, Facilities Services, Sustainability, Campus Services, Environmental Health & Safety, and academic/administrative departments along with outside consultants to ensure efficient project development in support of overall campus master plan initiatives. Serves as the project lead for numerous projects from the end of design development to the completion of construction, and in direct support of the project during all other phases, including planning and early design, until fully commissioned and occupied.\n\nEssential Functions\n\nAdminister multiple moderate size construction projects each ranging in size from $25,000 to $5 million. Also, to the extent assigned, may assist in the planning and design of such projects. Develop preliminary and final schedules, milestones, and budgets in collaboration with university departments and the Director of Construction. Solicit the assistance of appropriate cost estimators or contractors, to determine appropriate budgets for projects. Provide recommendations and assist in the selection of the design professional(s), communicate project scope, design intent and budget, negotiate fees, oversee the design, assure appropriate review of the design by appropriate university departments, assure the development of appropriate bidding documents, and manage the bidding process. Coordinate contract execution with the Director and the Business and Finance Department. Provide constructability review and solutions to questions posed by the design professionals. Maintain project records; monitor the project schedule, budget, and cash flow. If discrepancies arise, determine their legitimacy and whether alternative less expensive measures exist, discuss with appropriate design professional on the project, notify the Director with potential corrective measures. For projects designed by others, review drawings and specifications prepared by architects and engineers to become familiar with the project and to assure compliance with university standards. With a $3.7-billion, 9-million-square-foot physical plant, and a capital and renovation program that presently exceeds $100 million annually, the incumbent will lead numerous projects and initiatives simultaneously. (30%)Facilitate pre-bid presentations, walk-throughs, and planning meetings as part of the 2-person Campus Planning and Facilities Management project team with the CWRU Design Manager and in conjunction with customer needs in coordination with the design professionals and all prospective bidders.

Communicate and coordinate all legal issues with the Director and when required the CWRU legal counsel. (30%)Oversee the construction process for moderate multiple projects to confirm compliance with contract documents, university requirements, construction schedules, and a safe work site. Coordinate activities with adjacent areas and organizations, and to minimize disruptions to university operations. Regularly inspect each construction site on campus (frequency ranges from twice per week to several times a day depending on project’s complexity, schedule, amount of coordination for shutdowns and level of problems) to assess contractor’s compliance with contract documents, workplace safety, adherence to project schedules, quality of the work, and to understand and resolve problems. Verify the existence of a written, and when required site specific, contractor safety program. Coordinate with the university’s Environmental Health & Safety department and with appropriate outside agencies to coordinate preconstruction surveys or respond when unforeseen hazardous materials are discovered. As the university’s representative, participate in project job meetings with contractors and design professionals to monitor progress of the work, coordinate resolutions to problems that arise, and maintain records of all meetings. Ensure that all problems and significant project events are recorded and that written resolutions are communicated appropriately. Issue written and verbal communication to all appropriate parties (both internal and external) on critical project matters. As changes to the work become necessary including changes in scope, schedule, or budget, identify impacts and communicate all relevant information to CPFM leadership, end users, Facilities Services, affected departments and individuals, and members of the design and construction teams. Coordinate utility shutdowns and other construction project disruptions of university services with Facilities Services and appropriate departments. This will require research and communication within the campus community to anticipate user needs and planned disruptions of ongoing operations.

Facilitate a smooth transition from design to construction to final occupancy. Coordinate the transfer of all closeout documentation (including but not limited to, warranties, shop drawings, submittals, and as-built drawings) to appropriate departments. Verify that the university has received all deliverables identified in the contract. Ensure that during the project and at completion user department(s), including Facilities Services, Environmental Health & Safety, ITS, and Campus Services departments are familiar with the work so that they can use and maintain the equipment. Should post-construction problems arise, identify issues, and discuss appropriate corrective measures with the design professional and contractor(s). Consistently report issues with cost or time implications to the Director.
