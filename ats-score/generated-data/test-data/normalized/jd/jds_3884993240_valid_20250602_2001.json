Customers can use the Amazon app to enter the store, choose from an assortment of fresh meals and grocery essentials, and go. The checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out Technology, which detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re shopping is complete, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\n\nAmazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer\n\nAmazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.
