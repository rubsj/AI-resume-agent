The school encompasses 23 departments and 25 interdisciplinary programs. H&S is home to fundamental and applied research, where free, open, and critical inquiry is pursued across disciplines. As the university’s largest school, H&S serves as the foundation of a Stanford undergraduate education no matter which discipline students pursue as a major. Graduate students work alongside world-renowned faculty to pursue and shape foundational research that leads to breakthroughs and discoveries that shed new light on the past, influence the present, and shape the future. Together, faculty and students in H&S engage in inspirational teaching, learning, and research every day.\n\nDepartment/Program Description: The Departments of Philosophy and Religious Studies operate as two separate departments, but are both supported by the same core staff. The Department of Philosophy embodies a lively community of philosophers with a broad range of scholarly interests. The Department offer rigorous, competitive programs in traditional core areas of philosophy, as well as opportunities to explore sometimes-neglected subfields like feminist philosophy or aesthetics. The traditional strengths in logic and the philosophy of science remain central to the department, and they are now complemented by very strong programs in action theory, ethics and political philosophy, language, mind and epistemology, and the history of philosophy — especially ancient philosophy and Kant studies. The Department of Religious Studies is the principal hub and focal point at Stanford University for the academic study of religion, that is, the study both of religion in general as a human phenomenon and of specific religious traditions, from a scholarly and critical standpoint, using the tools and methods of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences.\n\nPosition Summary: The Departments of Philosophy and Religious Studies are seeking a Finance and Building Administrator to provide operational and administrative support to/for department faculty, staff and students.
