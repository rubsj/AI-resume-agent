This will be a full-time, tenure-track appointment with a flexible start date no later than August 2025. Candidates with an exemplary record of accomplishments in research and teaching may be offered discretionary research and professional development funds through the Barbara R. McIntosh Professorship.\nOur ideal candidate will be a graduate of an AACSB-accredited program OR an advanced Assistant Professor. The candidate must be granted a doctorate in OB, HRM or a related discipline (e.g., Management, Organization Studies, or Industrial & Organizational Psychology) prior to their intended start date. They should show ability and enthusiasm to (1) publish high quality research (e.g., FT50 or ABS 4 & 4*); (2) teach a 2/2 load at undergraduate and graduate levels, with preps in OB and HRM; and (3) contribute to extracurricular, experiential initiatives. While in the tenure track, candidates should consistently demonstrate a potential to build the research reputation of the GSB, develop compelling courses, and inspire students both inside and outside the classroom. In support of these contributions, this position offers AACSB competitive salary and benefits. In line with our commitment to transparency, the UVM Office of Institutional Research and Assessment regularly compiles a base pay list for paid university positions, as well as detailed breakdowns of faculty and staff by occupation, full/part-time status, tenure track status, unit, sex, race/ethnicity, and more.  The Grossman School of Business is AACSB accredited and employs 30 tenured and tenure-track faculty from multiple disciplines, as well as very experienced, professionally qualified, non-tenure-track faculty. Our faculty collaborate in their teaching and research within the GSB and with faculty in other UVM colleges and schools, fostering a culture of support and encouragement for junior faculty in their research and teaching. Senior faculty members are enthusiastic mentors who regularly publish in and hold editorships and editorial board appointments at top-tier journals such as Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Business Ethics, Journal of Management, Journal of Management Studies, Organization Studies, Strategic Management Journal, among many others.  Our undergraduate degree program provides a distinctive focus on three interdisciplinary themes: Global Business, Sustainable Business, and Entrepreneurship. The GSB has two remarkably successful graduate programs: the Sustainable Innovation MBA (SI-MBA) and the Master of Accountancy (MAcc). The SI-MBA program has consistently been named as a Top Green MBA by Princeton Review, most recently ranking #2 in 2021, 2022 and 2023, and ranking #1 in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The GSB is also known for hosting the annual Schlesinger Global Family Enterprise Case Competition (SG-FECC), where students from across the globe leverage expertise they have developed in the classroom towards solving complex family business cases. Candidates should be open to teaching in both the undergraduate and the graduate programs based on the school's needs.\nAbout UVM Since 1791, the University of Vermont has worked to move humankind forward.
