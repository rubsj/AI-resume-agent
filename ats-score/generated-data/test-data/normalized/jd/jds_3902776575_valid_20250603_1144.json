Strong background in neuroscience research techniques and methodologies. Experience with data analysis software (e.g., MATLAB and R). Excellent organizational, communication, and problem-solving skills. Ability to work independently and as part of a team.\n\nLab Specialist employees provide technical lab support by performing complex lab and research related tasks. They act as specialists on research methods and equipment functions specific to investigations. They have the authority to adapt methods and procedures to meet the needs of research. They are distinguished from Lab Technicians by the types and duration of assignments, as well as the skills and expertise necessary to serve as resources on non-routine problems. Lab Specialist employees perform daily activities without supervision; their longer-term assignments require greater oversight. Lab Specialist employees often train others on work processes and policies.\n\nAre you passionate about unraveling the mysteries of the human brain? Do you have a strong desire to contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in the field of neurodegenerative diseases? Look no further! The Lulu Jiang Lab at the University of Virginia (UVA) is seeking a lab technician (Lab Specialist) join our dynamic research team.\n\nResponsibilities Include\n\nConducting experiments and data analysis related to ongoing research projects.Contributing to the development and implementation of research protocols.Collaborating with fellow researchers and scientists within and outside the lab.Presenting research findings at conferences and publishing in scientific journals.Assisting in the training and mentorship of junior lab members.\n\nThe Lulu Jiang Lab is dedicated to advancing our understanding of the intricate workings of the brain. At our lab, we have a strong emphasis on comprehending the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and other related dementia disorders. Our primary objective is to deepen our understanding of these disease conditions. To achieve this, we employ cutting-edge technologies in disease modeling, allowing us to recreate and study the pathological processes in a controlled environment. By utilizing these advanced techniques, we gain insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms that underlie the progression of these diseases. Moreover, our lab is dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. We strive to translate our research findings into practical applications that could potentially lead to the discovery of novel treatments. By integrating our knowledge of disease mechanisms with targeted therapeutic approaches, we aim to make significant contributions to the field of neurodegenerative disease research. Overall, our lab is committed to advancing the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases through the utilization of state-of-the-art technologies and the exploration of molecular mechanisms.\n\nOur Research Focuses On Several Key Areas That Drive Our Scientific Interests And Contribute To The Understanding And Treatment Of Neurodegenerative Diseases. These Areas Include\n\n Investigation of RNA modifications and epitranscriptomic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. By studying how RNA modifications impact disease progression, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Exploration of neuron-glia interactions and neuroimmunological mechanisms underlying the progression of AD and Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding the complex interplay between neurons and glial cells will provide crucial insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Utilization of iPSC-induced 3D human brain organoid models to study neurodegenerative diseases and enable precision medicine approaches. These advanced models allow us to recapitulate the complexity of the human brain, facilitating the identification of disease mechanisms and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms driving prion-like propagation in the Braak stages of AD. Investigating the spread of pathological proteins in the brain will contribute to our understanding of disease progression and may lead to the development of interventions that disrupt this process. Development of innovative genetic and small molecule therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. Our research aims to identify and optimize potential therapeutic targets, including genetic approaches and small molecules, with the goal of ultimately translating these findings into effective treatments for patients.\n\nThese research directions represent our current focus and ongoing projects, which collectively contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the development of new strategies for the management and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nWith state-of-the-art facilities and a collaborative environment, we strive to foster creativity, innovation, and scientific excellence.\n\nFor more information about our department and our lab, please visit https://med.virginia.edu/neuroscience/ or contact Lulu Jiang at wpm5vs@virginia.edu.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree.Experience: 3 years of experience. 6 years of lab-related experience accepted in lieu of degree.\n\nThis position will remain open until filled. This is a non-exempt level, benefited position. For more information on the benefits at UVA, visit hr.virginia.edu/benefits. This position is a restricted position and is dependent upon project need, availability of funding, and performance. This position is located in Charlottesville, VA.\n\nThe University will perform background checks on all new hires prior to employment.
