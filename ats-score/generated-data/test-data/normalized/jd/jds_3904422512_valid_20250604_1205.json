The CRC position requires the incumbent to adhere to research protocols with an emphasis on organizational skills and attention to detail. In addition, given that the employee will be working in a publicly funded HIV clinic that serves many diverse and often marginalized urban populations, they will apply a warm and non-judgmental manner and consistently demonstrate interpersonal tact, discretion, and sensitivity when interacting with clinic patients and providers. Spanish language skills are highly encouraged given the impact of HIV on the Latinx community in San Francisco.\n\nThe Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is an NIH-funded center grant providing HIV research infrastructure and funding to the San Francisco HIV research community. The CFAR’s Clinical Core provides HIV researchers with access to a new patient referral service to recruit diverse participants from Ward 86 to research studies, as well as a well-characterized cohort for human subjects data and specimens (SCOPE), a platform from which to launch new studies, and a biospecimen processing and banking service. The Research Referral Service will implement a registry of patients from Ward 86, an HIV clinic at San Francisco General Hospital that serves a diverse patient population of over 2,600 persons, who are willing to participate in research studies.\n\nNew and established patients will have the opportunity to provide informed consent to the clinical research coordinator to join the CFAR recruitment registry database. The data manager can then efficiently query the database for participants that fit the inclusion criteria of various studies; the research recruitment coordinator will then reach out to eligible participants to recruit for a variety of studies. The CRC will also be the central point of contact to let registry participants know about available research studies.\n\nThe CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) -funded cohort of clinic cohorts consisting of eight academic HIV clinics across the United States, and UCSF is a participating member. The Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) component of CNICS involves a health assessment administered to clinic patients approximately every four months and contains information that the medical record often does not capture in a format conducive to evaluation and research, such as adherence to antiretroviral medication, sexual risk behavior, substance use, and mental health screening. The PROs survey is considered part of routine clinical care; deidentified data is transferred to the CNICS Data Coordinating Center for research purposes.\n\nFor CNICS, the CRC will be responsible for identifying eligible patients in the clinic, administering the health assessment on an iPad, and delivering results to the patient’s provider to aid with clinical care in real time. The CRC will also maintain a monthly report of eligible patients present in clinic, approached, declined / accepted, and surveys completed in order to troubleshoot reasons for refusal and non-completion.\n\nThe CRC position requires to adhere to research protocols with an emphasis on organizational skills and attention to detail. In addition, given that the employee will be working in a publicly funded HIV clinic that serves many diverse and often marginalized urban populations, they will apply a warm and non-judgmental manner and consistently demonstrate interpersonal tact, discretion, and sensitivity when interacting with clinic patients and providers. The CRC will meet regularly with their supervisor (CFAR Clinical Core Co-Director and UCSF CNICS principal investigator) to ensure study milestones are met.\n\nThe final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.\n\nTo see the salary range for this position (we recommend that you make a note of the job code and use that to look up): TCS Non-Academic Titles Search (https://tcs.ucop.edu/non-academic-titles)\n\nPlease note: An offer will take into consideration the experience of the final candidate AND the current salary level of individuals working at UCSF in a similar role.\n\nFor roles covered by a bargaining unit agreement, there will be specific rules about where a new hire would be placed on the range.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of working at UCSF, including total compensation, please visit: https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/index.html\n\nDepartment Description\n\nDEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Department of Medicine (DOM), the largest department in the School of Medicine, has close to 600 full- time faculty leading top-notch research, clinical, and education programs.
