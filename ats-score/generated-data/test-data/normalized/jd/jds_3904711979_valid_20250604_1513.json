Almada in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (SCRM); and Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.\n\nThe Almada Laboratory is investigating one of the greatest mysteries in muscle regenerative biology—how stem cells are turned on (activated) to rebuild functional muscle tissue after traumatic injury. Their multi-disciplinary team integrates state-of-the-art experimental and bioinformatic approaches to study this biological phenomenon at the molecular, cellular, and organ level in various vertebrate species, ranging the evolutionary continuum from lizards, to mice, and humans. Importantly, they investigate how stem cell dysfunction contributes to aging and muscular dystrophy, hoping to translate their basic science discoveries into therapies that benefit human health and longevity. The Almada lab is currently supported by two Junior Faculty awards from the Baxter Foundation, Glenn Foundation/American Federation of Aging Research (AFAR), and a recent R01 from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS).\n\nFor this position, we are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to engage in a project involving stem cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophy using mouse and human model systems. We have an ongoing collaboration with Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) to obtain muscle samples from DMD patients to facilitate this translational work. \n\nThis is a fixed-term, full-time position. The Postdoctoral Scholar will assist faculty with research studies. The annual base salary of this position is $70,000 - $70,000. When extending an offer of employment, the University of Southern California considers factors such as (but not limited to) the scope and responsibilities of the position, the candidate’s work experience, education/training, key skills, internal peer equity, federal, state, and local laws, contractual stipulations, grant funding, as well as external market and organizational considerations.\n\nEssential Duties and Responsibilities:\n\n\nServe as a research trainee for the purpose of enhancing and developing research competencies. Participates in planning, designing, and conducting highly technical and complex research projects under the direction of a supervisor. He/she may or may not work independently.Analyzes and evaluates research data utilizing computers and provides interpretations requiring significant knowledge of a specialized area of research. Searches literature, utilizing all available resources including electronic, regarding new methodology and designs experiments accordingly.Contributes to the development of research documentation for publication and/or prepares technical reports, papers, and/or records.Candidate will work on research projects in a highly interdisciplinary environment. Will work with senior research associates, technicians, PhD, and master’s students on projects related to stem cell biology and aging.\n\n\nPerforms other related duties as assigned or requested. The university reserves the right to add or change duties at any time.\n\nMinimum Education: Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate within previous five years Minimum Experience: 0-1 year Minimum Field of Expertise: Directly related education in any area of stem cell biology with advanced knowledge of equipment, procedures and analysis methods. Strong background in molecular and cellular biology is required. Preferred Education: Ph.D. in any area of molecular, cellular, stem cell biology, or computational biology. Preferred Experience: Experience with at least one of the following a plus: mouse genetics, fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), proteomics, or bioinformatic analysis. Preferred Field of Expertise: Publications in peer-reviewed journals in the same or related field.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Entry level",
