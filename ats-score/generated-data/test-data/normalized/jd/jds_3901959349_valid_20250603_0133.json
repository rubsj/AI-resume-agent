Our Technology and our Team. VALID’s core capabilities are driven by our fully automated transaction processing and patented risk decision engine, and our team of data scientists, technologists, risk analysts, innovators, and industry leaders bring these capabilities to life for our clients. This enables VALID to offer the most highly customized solutions that execute on the near impossible mission of minimizing risk, enhancing the customer experience, all at a profit for our clients. We are meticulous about our data, relentless in solving problems, and maniacal in the pursuit of our clients’ success. \nTHE TECHNOLOGY Our technology allows our clients to make the right transactional decisions, in real-time, and drive revenue. Leapfrogging the conventional static set of industry based risk rules and 2 day old account status responses, VALID leverages a proprietary risk modeling architecture that employs predictive analytics. Focusing on the key predictive data attributes and behavioral patterns, each decision, positive pay, and return are fed back into the automated decision engine, thereby creating a self-learning model that remains in a state of perpetual refinement. While the principles of VALID’s risk modeling are increasingly technical, extensive emphasis has been placed on both up front data attribute and decision response flexibility that allows for client specific tailoring. We provide this level of sophistication on each decision not only in sub-second real-time transaction speeds, but with industry leading security within our platform and data management. \nTHE TEAM Since 2003 VALID has focused on acquiring talent with an expertise that reflects its client base. Equal to that focus has been equipping that talent with the ability to execute against major initiatives and deliver on the objectives of our partners and clients. To that end VALID has fostered a culture that encourages our world-class talent to push the edges of conventional processes and think outside the box when facing problems. We develop solutions not to simply fix a problem, but looking ahead to better an industry. \nOUR CULTURE Google meets Wall-Street. We are casual in dress, but exceptionally professional in our expectations of our employees. We are all experts in our own business areas. We rely on one another, and trust has to be high for this to be successful. We value accountability in the workplace and family. We may not be monitoring you but we expect you to monitor yourself. \nIf you ask the people who work here, we’d tell you none of us has ever worked at a company quite like VALID Systems!\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
