The Selling Partner Services Agent Development team is seeking a Senior Learning Technology Manager to drive our technology initiatives from strategic roadmap creation to change management and implementation.\n\nIn this role you’ll lead our team through a time of changing tools, resources, and mental models. We’re working closely with 1P teams and 3P partners to deliver technical solutions that solve complex problems across training design, delivery, and performance measurement. Technology we support includes creating engaging learner content to be delivered both virtually and in classrooms worldwide; matching associates and investigators with the right classes, allows trainers to facilitate and manage classes; creating effective simulation for learners to practice what they’ve learned; assessing learners to prove their capabilities; and so much more.\n\nThis role is specifically responsible for Learning Experience Design (LXD) tools. Learning experience designers are responsible for creating learning content, practice cases, and assessments through authoring and case creation tools. This role is responsible for the LXD tool strategy, roadmap, and change management. The ideal candidate will be independent, collaborative, customer obsessed and hands-on as a technical training leader; comfortable working in highly ambiguous and fast paced environments.\n\nDoing this effectively requires strong relationship building skills as you’ll be working closely with technology partners, 3P providers, business intelligence, training design, and delivery leaders. We’re looking for leaders who have experience in learning technology, from roadmap creation to delivery and implementation. We are a team of 500 designers, trainers, and program leaders, so the ability to enable change at scale is critical. If you love operating as a strategic leader and thoughtful change manager, we’d love to talk to you.\n\nBusiness problem, program strategy, and technology product solutions may not yet be defined and the ideal candidate must be able to deliver independently with limited guidance. This role will own tools leveraged globally, and manage the lifecycle of complex cross-functional technology initiatives including integrations with other systems. The right candidate understands risks and implications to the team caused by technical complexity and must be able to drive simplification, efficiency and balance tradeoffs with existing engineering and architectures to unblock innovation and speed of delivery. Further, the candidate should be able to distill these risks and effectively communicate to the team and appropriate stakeholders to lead mitigation efforts. Being able to find a path forward in difficult and complex situations is a must. This candidate is continuously learning and iterating to ensure we are solving critical problems to meet needs and goals.\n\nLastly, passion for people development is critical to success in this role. We think of people development two ways: as a product we’re responsible to deliver to the organizations we support; and as individual leaders where you’ll be charged with empowering and elevating those around you.\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\n Create and own LXD strategy for Agent Development organization Define LXD goals and proactively communicate progress, issues, and risks Maintain and prioritize backlog for LXD requirements and partner with 1P and 3P technology teams Lead cross-functional project team to improve the learning experience and deliver results Define and manage success metrics across tool engagement and satisfaction Own OP1/OP2 intake, prioritization, and submission for LXD tools & partner with 1P and 3P teams for prioritization Proactively communicate LXD strategy, quarterly roadmap updates, monthly LXD updates, and key data points to stakeholders and customers Operate as an authority and subject matter expert from customer insight through technical challenges and execution Develop feedback mechanism to ensure you are working backwards from the customer/persona, surfacing key pain points, and validating that the solutions address them.\n\nWe are open to hiring candidates to work out of one of the following locations:\n\nArlington, VA, USA | Seattle, WA, USA\n\nBasic Qualifications\n\n Bachelor's degree 5+ years of experience in learning technology, program, or product management 5+ years of experience working cross functionally with tech and non-tech teams Experience with owning/driving roadmap strategy and definition Experience with feature delivery and tradeoffs of a product Exceptional project management skills, including the ability to manage multiple products simultaneous and meet deadlines\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n Experience creating and delivering effective learning content Experience with 3P CMS tools Proven track record of taking ownership and delivering results in ambiguous problem spaces Strong understanding of instructional design and learning technology Strong analytical and quantitative skills; experience using data and metrics to test theories, confirm assumptions, and measure success\n\nAmazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.
