Work on systems of small size and elementary complexity or segments of larger systems under general supervision. SHP invites applicants for a full-time Health Economic Software Developer Associate position, to develop microsimulation models to inform policy relating to cancer, and other non-communicable diseases.\n\nSHP produces interdisciplinary, world-class research on domestic and international health that advances our understanding of how health care can be delivered and shapes the formulation of health care policy worldwide. This critical work takes place across campus with multiple schools, organizations and individuals. At SHP, our mission focuses on interdisciplinary innovation, discovery, and education to improve health policy. To achieve this mission, we develop and apply cutting-edge methodology from decision sciences, statistics, machine learning, AI, and health economics. The development and use of microsimulation models is essential to evaluate current and yet-to-be-observed health policies.\n\nSHP seeks a Health Economic Software Developer Associate to join the modeling team led by Assistant Professor Fernando Alarid-Escudero that conducts modeling analyses on the health impact, costs and cost-effectiveness of cancer, other non-communicable diseases and infectious disease prevention and treatment programs to inform health policy and guide public health decision-making and prioritize future research at local, state, national and international levels. The Health Economic Software Developer Associate will join multi-institutional research groups, including CISNET (https://cisnet.cancer.gov), a consortium of cancer modelers funded by NCI that focus on the long-term objective of reducing the impact of cancer by providing the information needed to address key policy questions and prioritize future research, and The Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup (https://darthworkgroup.com). The successful applicant will take a lead role in the development and application of microsimulation models and contribute to a broader portfolio of projects through regular participation in working groups.\n\nStanford University is an equal-opportunity employer and is committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty and academic staff. It welcomes nominations of and applications from women and members of minority groups, as well as others who would bring additional dimensions to the University’s research, teaching, and clinical missions. The culture of the group is inquisitive, collaborative, and inclusive so that team members can do their best work. We have high standards for rigor, quality, and ethics and help each other learn to reach these objectives.\n\nThe Health Economic Software Developer Associate will execute all programming tasks, including programming, analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, modifying, and maintaining computer programs. Work on systems of small to moderate size and complexity or segments of larger systems. More specifically, the appointed person will work on simulation model-based evaluation of health policies, medical technologies including pharmaceuticals, therapeutic devices, and diagnostics; public health and social care research; development of methods; and evaluative research focusing on the U.S. and low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe Health Economic Software Developer Associate will have training opportunities to develop their analytical skills in economic evaluation, including advanced decision analysis, microsimulation simulation modeling, statistical analysis of individual-level data, data science, AI, and evidence synthesis.\n\nDuties Include\n\n Assess user needs and requirements. Assist with design and development of applications that may involve sophisticated data manipulation. Assist with maintaining and updating existing programs. Troubleshoot and solve basic technical problems. Assist in the design and implementation of user and operations training programs. Contribute to documenting changes in software for end users.
