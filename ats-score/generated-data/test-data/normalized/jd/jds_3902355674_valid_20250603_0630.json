This role will discover and develop life saving medicines to treat brain tumors in children. The Senior Research Associate executes high quality experiments and reports data across a wide variety of inquiries to further our understanding of the safety and efficacy of our pipeline candidates. In addition, this role should demonstrate near independent data analysis and will be expected to design basic experiments with little oversight from senior lab staff. For this role, interpretation of data will be mostly independent from senior lab staff and reports of data should include concepts on how to build on data with future experiments. Success in this position will be defined by high organizational skills, excellent quality, on-time delivery of experimental results. Lastly, ability to report clear and concise results in both written record and in presentation to colleagues. \nKey responsibilities:Laboratory Experimentation: Perform high-quality, meticulous bench work in a wide variety of contexts, including cell-based assays, molecular analyses, and molecular cloning of candidate constructs and tools as needed by the program. Design basic experiments independently and provide meaningful input to more complex scientific problems. Data Analysis and Reporting: Perform standard analysis and interpretation of data generated from your own work and that of others. Generate figures and slides to describe the outcome of experiments to colleagues. Propose logical next steps with data-driven justification for how the team should proceed. Timely Documentation: Maintainan up-to-date ELN record, ensuring that current and future colleagues can quickly gain a clear understanding of your experimental design, its assumptions, and its outcomes. Store and catalog data with consistent adherence to laboratory guidelines. Participation in Lab Maintenance: Work collaboratively with your colleagues and operations staff to ensure basic laboratory maintenance tasks are completed to ensure smooth and efficient operation of the lab space. Adapt to Lab Needs:Put forth effort to engage in cross-disciplinary training and step in to support teams experiencing unusually high workload, including Bioproduction Core and In Vivo Core as necessary. Train and support junior colleagues: Identify and engage in opportunities to train junior colleagues on new techniques. Support the work of others in the lab by cross-training and willingly assisting colleagues where possible. Key Behaviors and Skills:Meticulous organization:Maintain highly organized and understandable notes for assigned experiments. Conduct experiments in an organized manner, ensuring all data is collected and stored in accordance with lab policy. Collaboration:Work closely with a variety of groups and individuals to ensure that the team’s effort is optimally applied to achieving our goals. Become comfortable with discomfort and be open to learning new techniques and growing your skillset. Drive to Learn and Grow:Expand your expertise in CAR-T by learning from your senior colleagues as well as self-teaching and proactively pursuing answers to your own knowledge gaps. Accept failure and learn from it. Strengthen the team by supporting the growth of your junior colleagues. Qualifications:Bachelor’s degree in cell biology, molecular biology, immunology, bioengineering, chemical engineering, or related fieldAt least two years of relevant laboratory experience in an industrial settingMust have demonstrated experience of working effectively on teamsMust align with the Brainchild Bio Mission and Values\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
