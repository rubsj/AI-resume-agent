Software development is vital to empowering our scientific explorations and generating viable paths to the consumer products people will use for decades to come — products that will truly give people superpowers. At RL-R Codec Avatars, we aspire to a vision of social VR and AR where people are able to interact with each other across distances in a way that is indistinguishable from in-person interactions, with Codec Avatars that look like you and move like you. We're just getting started. You can help us make this dream a reality and accomplish your life’s best work here!In the calibration team, we are looking for a talented and motivated software engineer that can help us build data processing pipelines, as the data move from our motion capture systems and devices to functional codec avatars for photorealistic telepresence applications. Help us build the future of telepresence of the Metaverse!\n\nSoftware Engineer - Calibration Team Responsibilities:\n\nAnalyze, evaluate, design, develop, integrate, debug and test calibration algorithms, software tools, processing pipelinesPrototype software-hardware interfaces for characterizing, modeling and calibration of camera lenses and image sensorsDesign intuitive software APIs that researchers and engineers can effectively useParticipate in design reviews and code reviewCollaborate in a team environment across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, making architectural trade-offs required to rapidly deliver software solutionsWork with mechanical, software, research engineers, and research scientists to understand challenges in building state-of-the-art software systemsWrite clean readable code, debug complex problems that span systems, prioritize ruthlessly, work efficientlyLearn constantly, educate others, dive into new areas with unfamiliar technologies, and embrace the ambiguity of AR/VR problem solving\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nCurrently has, or is in the process of obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, relevant technical field, or equivalent practical experience. Degree must be completed prior to joining Meta.3+ years experience with modern C++ and PythonExperience with software development practices such as source control, code reviews, unit testing, debugging and profilingExperience developing APIs, SDKs and developer toolsExperience working independently and in highly dynamic environments\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\n5+ years hands-on experience with Python and modern C++Experience with software development on various operating systems such as Linux, Android, MacOS, and WindowsExperience developing data engineering pipelines for consumption in machine learning workflowsExperience with traditional relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQLKnowledge of estimation theory, path planning, optimization, optimal solversComputer vision or computer graphics experienceExperiences in working with large-scale datasets, developing deep learning training frameworks, and developing PyTorch extensions in C++ or CUDAExperience developing, debugging, and shipping software products on large code bases that span platforms and toolsExperience with parallel computing with GPU’s using CUDA\n\nAbout Meta:\n\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible today—beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.\n\nMeta is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
