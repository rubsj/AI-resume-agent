Supply Continuity Stewardship activities support CFA and our sourcing leads via commodity analysis & hedging activities. Further, we lead the capacity & contingency planning (CapCon) practice to support future growth and measure supply chain health. We also create informational advantages for negotiations and pricing through our Expected Cost Tool (ECT), negotiation support, sustainability, new risk identification and mitigation strategies, and diverse supplier development.\n\nIn our work, we interact with all sourcing leads, suppliers, and secondary suppliers. We require strong analytical skills balanced with creativity to identify, strategize, and communicate our priorities to attain cross-functional support. Our ideal candidate is humble, willing to learn, a teacher, a leader, a great communicator, and focuses on serving others. This role requires a seasoned commodity trader, who has managed through a variety of challenging markets, and has the mental scars necessary to manage through the next unforeseen event. This person knows when to stick to their bias and when they need to shift their strategy. The Commodity Analyst will play a crucial role in ensuring the seamless oversight and mitigation of commodity risk within Chick-fil-A’s supply chain. This person will help formulate strategy, execute our bias, and will have responsibility for the continuous improvement of the program – there is still a lot of white space. This person will lead the COGS reporting and forecasting process and become an information source for negotiations. This position strongly favors previous procurement or sales experience as the role is expected to offer novel negotiating tactics and solutions as a supportive coach to the team. While the primary work is around commodity risk, this person must be able to offer far more via their past experiences. Should Chick-fil-A pursue hedging via its own brokerage account instead of via OTC swap counterparties and supplier partners, this person will have the ability to build the necessary infrastructure with appropriate oversight, as well as help build out the team managing trade execution and delta hedging.\n\nThis position is based out of the Chick-fil-A Support Center Office in Atlanta, GA.\n\nOur Flexible Future model offers a healthy mix of working in person and virtually, strengthening key elements of the Chick-fil-A culture by fostering collaboration and community.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n Commodity Risk:  Create commodity risk mitigation strategies to manage our grains, edible oils, dairy, softs, and energy exposure.
