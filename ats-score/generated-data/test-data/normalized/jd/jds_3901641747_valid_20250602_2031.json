The Barnoud lab focuses on the p53 tumor suppressor, the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Specifically, the lab is seeking to understand the impact of genetic variants of p53 on the tumor microenvironment and response to cancer immunotherapy. A second goal of the Barnoud lab is to identify novel therapeutic strategies in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including the role of heat shock proteins in pancreatic and liver cancer. The candidate should be highly motivated with a recent Ph.D. degree, or a Graduate Student about to receive a Ph.D. degree, with a solid background in cancer biology and/or immunology. Experience with flow cytometry and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) is highly desirable.\nThe Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) is the only NCI-Designated Cancer Center in South Carolina. Currently, HCC researchers hold approximately $45 Million in annual extramural cancer research funding with $23 Million originating from the NCI.\nMUSC is located in historic Charleston, South Carolina. The weather is beautiful year-round, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing during winter. There are several beaches within minutes of the city and the mountains are only three hours away. In addition to these amenities, the art, history, food, and festivals make Charleston an outstanding place to live.\nTo apply, please use the application link provided, or send a cover letter outlining your research interests and career goals, CV with a list of publications, and the contact information of three references to barnoud@musc.edu. Interested applicants may also apply directly here:\nhttps://musc.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/MUSC/job/Charleston/UNIV-Postdoctoral-Fellow-Department-of-Biochemistry_R-0000027704\nMinimum Requirements: PhD or Equivalent\nJob Duties:\n25%- Collaborates with the PI and other lab members involved to design and execute experiments using state-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models, and cells prepared form these models, to study the role of p53 variants in cancer risk, with a focus on gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. These duties include genotyping of genetically engineered mice and animal husbandry, in vivo experiments, including treatment studies, monitoring for development of disease, necropsies of experimental mice and in vitro studies, including preparing cells from the models, cell culture, flow cytometry, molecular and functional genomic evaluation of gene expression and transcription factor binding to target genes, including, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and proteomics.\n25%- Collaborates in the generation of novel HSP70 inhibitors and their impact on the initiation, progression, and metastasis of GI and other solid tumors. Performs in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine efficacy and safety of inhibitors, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. Performs multi-omic analysis of genetic and/or pharmaceutical ablation of heat shock proteins and its impact on cell biology.\n20%- Collaborates in collecting and analyzing data generated from the experiments. Duties include keeping accurate records on a daily basis, using appropriate software for analysis of data, and collaborating with Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Research Shared Resources to ensure quality of the results, interpreting results, and planning new experiments.\n20%- Collaborates in preparing manuscripts and grants based on the experimental data generated. Duties include keeping current with the literature, preparing figures based on data collected, writing manuscripts and sections of grants with the PI and senior team members, presenting current work in research in progress seminars, attending departmental seminars and participating in journal clubs.\n10%- Helps with laboratory maintenance and regulatory compliance, i.e., ordering, cleanup of lab areas, maintenance of equipment, helping to prepare IACUC protocols and amendments when appropriate.\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
