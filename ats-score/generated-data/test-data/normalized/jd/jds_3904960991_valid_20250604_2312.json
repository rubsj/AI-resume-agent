We are passionate about the work we do every day at Agenus to deliver on the promise of immuno-oncology. If you’re looking for an inspired environment, passionate colleagues, and a culture that nurtures learning, innovation and team success, we invite you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nWe are seeking a Senior Scientist with expertise in Protein Mass Spectrometry (MS) to join our Analytical Development team as a subject matter expert in mass spectrometric analysis of protein therapeutics with the goal to understand structural/biological function correlation to support the Agenus therapeutic protein pipeline (monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins, bispecific antibodies, etc.).\n\nThis role will report to the head of Analytical Development and will be responsible for developing, qualifying, and performing Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) based methods to be used for characterization and/or GMP quality control of therapeutic proteins in all clinical stages (from early to pre-BLA). The candidate will design and execute scientific studies and will collaborate extensively with cross-functional Agenus staff and with representatives from contract manufacturing and testing organizations.\n\nIn The Role You Will\n\n Establish (develop, optimize and qualify) and perform LC-MS based analysis to characterize product and process variants for Agenus protein therapeutic candidates including analyses of intact/reduced molar mass, post-translational modifications (oxidation, deamidation, glycosylation, etc.), disulfide bond structure, free thiols, sequence variant analysis, etc.This also includes routine maintenance and training of group members, as well as knowledge sharing with MS groups located in other internal sites. Support pharmaceutical products throughout their lifecycle, such as development samples from Upstream Process Development and Downstream Purification Development, Formulation Development, DS and DP Manufacturing. Provide scientific input and demonstrate critical thinking into experimental design and execution Write technical development reports and give oral presentations of data at departmental or interdepartmental meetings. Write, review, and edit SOPs and Test Methods for new procedures and assays; review, edit and revise existing SOPs to reflect changes in procedures. Act as analytical subject matter expert and contribute to the authoring and review of regulatory CMC sections (IND, BLA/MAA).
