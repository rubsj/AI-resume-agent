You will oversee and direct the development of one-of-a-kind systems for multiple experimental programs in support of LLNL’s stockpile stewardship mission. You will be a key contributor in the design, instrumentation, and execution of unique experiments employing high power pulsed electrical energy and/or energetic materials (high explosives) to study matter in extreme states. You will have the opportunity to bring your creativity and innovation to bear on some of the most challenging technical problems our nation faces and guide the development of novel engineering practices and approaches to continually improve the performance and reliability of R&D systems. These positions are in the National Security Engineering Division (NSED) within the Engineering Directorate and may require travel as part of a program assignment.These positions will be filled at either level based on knowledge and related experience as assessed by the hiring team. Additional job responsibilities (outlined below) will be assigned if hired at a higher level.\nYou will Oversee and direct activities for the design, laboratory testing, and analysis of pulsed power and electromagnetic devices and components in support of state-of-the-art pulsed power experimental platform research and development.Propose ideas experimental campaigns in support of programmatic goals and objectives: oversee and direct activities of small team in the execution of experiments and experimental campaigns.Provide independent assessments, and analysis, of complex pulsed power and electromagnetic system performance and risk.Serve as the primary technical contact on a multi-disciplinary team to direct efforts in the fulfillment of program objectives.Adhere to the highest standards of personnel safety and facility oversight while leading the execution of high-value, high-consequence demonstrations and experiments.Present and disseminate research results at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, in open and classified environments, internal and external to LLNL.Perform other duties as assigned.Additional job responsibilities, at the SES.4 levelDirect technical tasks and influence technical direction in the execution of highly complex experimental campaigns requiring teams of moderate-to-large size. Serve as a subject matter expert in applied electromagnetics and/or pulsed power system design and analysis for the laboratory, at-large.Work with senior and program management to establish and revise strategic roadmaps for programmatic efforts and technology thrust areas. Routinely interact with senior LLNL management, program sponsors, other national laboratory staff and/or external entities to enable the execution of experimental campaigns. QualificationsAbility to secure and maintain a US DOE Q level security clearance which requires U.S. citizenship.Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering, Physics, or a related field, or the equivalent combination of education and relevant previous experience.Significant experience in applied electromagnetics and/or pulsed power systems and technology.Significant experience with diagnostics used in electromagnetic and/or pulsed power systems. Experience in overseeing and directing small teams to conduct experiments.Experience working within large, multi-disciplinary teams.Ability to travel.Advanced written and verbal skills necessary to author and communicate technical reports, publications and presentations, to internal and external organizations.Additional job responsibilities, at the SES.4 levelExpertise in innovation and creativity in solving highly complex problems with ill-defined requirements and constraints.Expertise in overseeing and directing moderate-to-large sized teams to conduct experiments.Experience in direct interaction with senior leadership, sponsors or customers during the course of programmatic work.Qualifications We DesirePhD in Electrical Engineering or related field or the equivalent combination of education and relevant experience.Experience in conducting experiments with high explosive pulsed power systems.Experience with grounding and shielding techniques and electromagnetic comparability practices.Experience with advanced scientific modeling and simulation tools.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
