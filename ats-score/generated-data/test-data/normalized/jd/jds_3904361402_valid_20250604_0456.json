Work is done in a low volume high mix environment.Establishes appropriate machining methods and tool sequences. Determines the necessary fixturing and tooling to maintain tight tolerances.Possesses working knowledge of CAD (Solidworks/AutoCAD) and CAM software (Mastercam) to create efficient and repeatable toolpaths.Employees will use advanced inspection equipment, ex. CMM and digital optical measuring.Create and maintain job documentation files. Collects and analyzes process data and provides input to the project team.Trains and assists in the development of personnel (cross-training).Conduct preventative maintenance, 5S and housekeeping duties.Participate in the product development process and provide input during concept development and feasibility testing.Handle engineering model shop schedule in coordination with the Manager, and NPI Project leadsHandle engineering model shop safety program, including PPE and training requirementsAssess the manufacturability of new designs and provide improvement feedback to Engineers.Perform other duties as required.\n\nQualifications\n\n Education, Experience & Certifications\n\n7 to 10 years of experience working on CNC equipment.Must have a minimum of 2 years of CNC programming experience (Mastercam) and 3 years of CNC setup experience.High School diploma or equivalentWorking knowledge of manufacturing methods, tooling, fixturing, and materials.Proficiency with CAD/CAM software knowledge (Solidworks, AutoCAD, Mastercam), skills and abilities.Excellent knowledge of blueprint reading and drawing interpreting. GD&T required.Experience working with a wide range of steels. (CRS, Aluminum, Hastelloy, Inconel, etc).Experience working with magnet materials is a plus.Ability to program, set up, and run complex jobs without supervision.Proficiency with MS Office tools. (word/excel) \n\nSuccessful Essential Skills\n\nExcellent problem-solving skills use rigorous logic and methods to solve problems producing effective solutions to problem statements.Strong technical skills. Ability to set up and run a variety of machines while holding very tight tolerances with limited direction creating quality parts to spec on prototype parts (first part, good part). Primary equipment: OD, ID, and surface Grinders as well as rough and precision slicers. Lathe, Mill, and EDM machines as a secondary skillStrong machine shop math and complex blueprint reading skills, including GD&TAble to develop required fixturing and tooling to perform everyday tasksAble to understand G and M codesAble to adjust programs for optimal speed, reliability, and tool lifeKnowledge and use of a wide variety of precision measuring equipmentInnovation - Apply our collective machining knowledge to make \"impossible parts\"Evaluate prints and solid model CAD FilesTo excel in this position, you must leverage those skills to be proficient at CAD/CAM programming, setup, and operation of CNC machinesMachining on Magnetic Material is a plus\n\nSuccessful Essential Behaviors\n\nIs action-oriented and independent. Has a heightened sense of urgency and works at a quick pace (high energy).Uses creativity to make connections among unrelated notions and is seen as having original thought.Attention to detail: focus on accuracy, completeness, and following standards, rules, regulations, and requirements.Cooperative with others and usually helpful to the rest of the team in getting work done.Upholds the values and beliefs of the organization. Exhibits integrity as a person and in their work. Maintains appropriate confidentiality at work.Is personally committed to and actively works to continuously his/her work skills.Has a can-do, will-do attitude.\n\nWork Environment and Physical Demands \n\nWorks in a clean, air-conditioned, and well-lit production environment- protective foot and eyewear required.60% Standing on cement floors with rubber mats, 20% Sitting, 10% Stooping and Bending and 10% WalkingLift and transport an average weight of 10 lbs., maximum of 40 lbs.Manual dexterity of both hands.Near Visual Acuity (either corrected or uncorrected).Ability to understand verbal direction and instruction. Ability to give feedback to engineers and brainstorm with others on the prototype team. Must be able to read, understand, and comply with all quality and safety regulations.\n\nInteractions\n\nRegular contact and communications with all levels of the organization.\n\nSupervision Provided\n\nNone\n\nHow This Position Contributes to the Effectiveness of the Quality Management System\n\nThe Sr. Prototype Machinist is responsible for manufacturing the first piece article according to customer specifications. That work is critical to securing customer approval to move forward in the manufacturing process.\n\nFailure to meet quality standards can result in not securing the order from the customer.\n\nJob Descriptions are influenced by environmental change, the company’s objectives, products, and processes. They can change at any time due to business needs.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
