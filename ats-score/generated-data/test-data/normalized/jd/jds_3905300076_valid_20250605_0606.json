The Principal Investigator, Prof. Josep M Llovet, is Professor of Medicine and Director of the Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Program. As a key member of our team, you will play a crucial role in liver cancer translational research by designing and executing studies with human samples and experimental models.\n\nThe main goal of our laboratory is to unravel the molecular determinants of liver cancer onset and progression, identify novel treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and discover predictors of response to molecular and immune therapies. We lead an International Consortium devoted to liver cancer research, and have produced important contributions in the field over the past years. \n\nResearch projects may involve, but are not limited to: 1) analysis of the tumor microenvironment of HCC by applying cutting edge technologies such as single cell sequencing; 2) generation of novel animal models of the disease; and 3) therapeutic targets discovery in sophisticated in vitro systems. Current areas of interest include the mapping of the immune cell microenvironment in human HCC related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the identification of biomarkers of response to treatments (including immune checkpoint inhibitors and combinations), and the development of mouse models and innovative preclinical models that recapitulate specific NASH-HCC features to test the efficacy of novel therapies and assess their mechanisms of action. Our efforts are supported by several national and international grants, including an NCO-RO1 starting August 2023.\n\nThe candidate will work within a multidisciplinary team of basic biologists, physician scientists, computational biologists, and clinicians at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai in the Division of Liver Diseases. The candidateâ€™s duties will also include supervision and mentoring of PhD students and project coordination. The position and environment offers opportunities for career development, leadership experience, and scientific publications and presentations. \n\n\nQualifications\nREQUIREMENTS\n-PhD in a research field related to cancer translational medicine\n-Advanced level in written and spoken English\n-Proven track record of first-author publications\n-Hardworking and motivated\n\nREQUIRED EXPERIENCE\n-Experience in cancer research\n-Stays abroad (>1 year), preferably in worldwide recognized scientific institutions.\n\nAdditional preferred skills:\n-Experience in cancer molecular biology\n-Experience in cancer genomics\n-Experience in immunology\n-Experience in animal modeling of cancer\n-Experience in bioinformatics\n \n\n\nMount Sinai is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds. We value diversity and inclusion in our research community.\n\nApplication Deadline, salary and benefits: Applications will be evaluated until a suitable candidate will be identified. Salary will be based on experience and assigned according NIH policy. Mount Sinai provides a competitive package which includes subsidized housing and health insurance.\n\nPlease note that only shortlisted candidates will be contacted for an interview.\n\nCompensation Statement\nThe Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) provides a salary range to comply with the New York City Law on Salary Transparency in Job Advertisements. The salary range for this role is $58,661.00 - $60,788.00 Annually. Actual salaries depend on a variety of factors, including experience, education, and hospital need. The salary range or contractual rate listed does not include bonuses/incentive, differential pay or other forms of compensation or benefits.\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
