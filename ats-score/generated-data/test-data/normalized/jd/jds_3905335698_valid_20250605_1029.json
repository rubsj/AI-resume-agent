We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, borrow, and grow their money – all in one place.\n\nThe U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.\n\nWhat makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.\n\nThere’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!\n\nThe role\n\nWe’re looking for an experienced UX Writer/Content Designer to join us on our mission to help people achieve financial progress.

Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within One.\n\nInclusion & Belonging\n\nTo build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us at talent@one.app.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Entry level",
