No unsolicited resumes will be accepted. Agencies must be expressly engaged by the 4DMT Talent Acquisition team on any requisition. Agencies reaching out directly to hiring managers will not be tolerated and doing so may impact your ability to work with 4DMT in the future.\n\n4DMT is a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company harnessing the power of directed evolution for targeted genetic medicines. We seek to unlock the full potential of gene therapy using our platform, Therapeutic Vector Evolution (TVE), which combines the power of directed evolution with our approximately one billion synthetic AAV capsid-derived sequences to invent evolved vectors for use in our products. We believe key features of our targeted and evolved vectors will help us create targeted product candidates with improved therapeutic profiles. These profiles will allow us to treat a broad range of large market diseases, unlike most current genetic medicines that generally focus on rare or small market diseases.\n\nWe have built a deep portfolio of AVV-based gene therapy product candidates, with five product candidates in clinical trials: 4D-150 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME), 4D-710 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease, 4D-310 for the treatment of Fabry disease cardiomyopathy, 4D-125 for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), and 4D-110 for the treatment of choroideremia. In addition, we have two product candidates in preclinical studies: 4D-175 for geographic atrophy (GA) and 4D-725 for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\nTo-date, we have demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept for three evolved vectors in three therapeutic areas and routes of administration with five products and patient populations. We believe this validates the power of our directed evolution platform for discovering superior vectors compared to wildtype viral vectors. We have built a robust and efficient product engine with 6 open Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) in the U.S., 1 IND in Taiwan, and 1 Clinical Trial Approval (CTA) in Australia. We believe we are positioned to create, develop, manufacture and, if approved, effectively commercialize targeted genetic medicines that could transform the lives of patients suffering from debilitating diseases.\n\nIn addition to TVE, our technology includes a robust AAV manufacturing platform and onsite manufacturing facility that allows us to rapidly produce and test research grade material and scale up to GMP clinical material. This internal capability and close collaboration between our R&D and Manufacturing teams has greatly accelerated the pace of discovery at 4DMT.\n\nCompany Differentiators:\n\n Fully integrated clinical-phase company with internal manufacturing Demonstrated ability to move rapidly from idea to IND Five candidate products in the clinic and two declared pre-clinical programs Robust technology and IP foundation, including our TVE and manufacturing platforms Initial product safety and efficacy data substantiates the value of our platforms Opportunities to expand to other indications and modalities within genetic medicine\n\nGENERAL SUMMARY: \n\nThe Principal Data Scientist: Statistical Programming will report to the VP, Data Science and will focus on applying programming methodology for implementing statistical analyses using SAS for in-house deliverables and performing quality review of outsourced statistical deliverables.
