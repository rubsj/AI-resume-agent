By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nBackend Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations use data. Our Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, prototyping, and production delivery. You will collaborate closely with technical and non-technical teammates to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We encourage movement across teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different technologies and aspects of each product. Engineers work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop, becoming a strong technical contributor and engineering leader.\n\nOur Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product. Our infrastructure teams are responsible for the lowest layers of our software stack, often focused on database technologies, distributed systems, large scale data systems, security, and application infrastructure. As a Software Engineer on infrastructure, you'll contribute high-quality code to underpin Palantir Foundry and Gotham with performant, secure, and scalable building blocks, enabling products deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build the foundational capabilities that power our products used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nWe're hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real-world problems and empowering developers and end-users to do their work optimally. If you’re motivated to develop reliable, performant, scalable systems and design robust APIs and primitives, below are some examples of the types of product work you’d get to do in this role:\n\nBuilding performant search and indexing ecosystem for complex granularly permissioned of dataContributing to open-source data processing libraries, integrating the latest innovations to achieve performance gainsBuilding the distributed systems that power large scale compute workloads, orchestrating and efficiently scheduling hundreds of thousands of containers every hourDesigning architecture and opinionated APIs to keep application developers on the happy pathTracing and performance observability in high scale distributed microservice architecturesBuilding reliant, performant, and scalable systems for storage, auth, or asset serving to enable other product teams to build robust applications without deep domain expertise in the underlying systemsAutomating the deployment, management, and operations of complex distributed systems like Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and more across different environments\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nDifferent backend languages, including Java, Rust, and GoOpen-source technologies like Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Spark, Kafka, Kubernetes, FlinkIndustry-standard build tooling, including Gradle and GitHub\n\nWhat We Value\n\nDemonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. Able to iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how technical decisions impact them.Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience. Experience developing and managing highly-available distributed systems is beneficial, but not required.Bias towards quality and thoughtful about edge cases (“anything that can go wrong will go wrong”); writes code that is defensive against all possibilities.Builds solutions and APIs with users in mind while maintaining a high engineering bar. Seeks to centralize and abstract complexity away from our users in order to expose simple, powerful APIs for consumers.Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial, but not necessary.\n\nWhat We Require\n\nEngineering background in Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics or similar field.Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, Rust, or similar languages.Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools.Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality.\n\nOur benefits aim to promote health and wellbeing across all areas of Palantirians’ lives.
