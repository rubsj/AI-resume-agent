The candidate will have a strong track record in both cutting edge organic synthesis/ medicinal chemistry, with a demonstrated ability to thrive and contribute in a multi-disciplinary fast-paced environment. The successful candidate will be responsible for the synthesis of small-molecule drug candidates and the analysis of diverse data sets to build structure-activity relationships (SAR) to help drive medicinal chemistry strategy. Proficiency/ experience in the design of new molecules to support SAR and advancement of projects, as well as structure-based design is a plus. We are looking for individuals who have a passion for drug-discovery, and embrace our core values of scientific excellence, high innovation, collaboration, and putting people and patients first.\nESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:Under general supervision, independently conduct multi-step synthesis of target molecules. Purify and characterize compounds using a variety of techniques including chromatography, crystallization, trituration, LCMS, NMR, etc.Independently design and optimize synthetic routes. Solve synthetic chemistry problems to enable access to new chemical space and novel IP.Champion the application of cutting-edge modern synthetic chemistry to enable efficient access to complex target molecules at both milligram and multi-gram scale.Efficiently analyze complex data sets to develop a deep understanding of SAR. Contribute to the design of new molecules to advance project goals. Productively interact with cross-functional scientists (e.g. biology, structural biology, ADME/Tox) to advance project goals. Effectively communicate results and progress in both individual and multi-disciplinary team settings.Stay abreast of the literature in both synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry and proactively apply knowledge to support company research objectives. Contribute to the day to day running of the lab to ensure a smooth and safe operation. Maintain a safe working environment and adhere to all corporate lab safety standards.Assist in the preparation of patents and publications, as required.Maintain excellent record keeping, including updated and well-organized lab e-notebooks.Perform other duties as assigned.  EDUCATION/KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS/ABILITIES REQUIRED:Ph.D. in synthetic organic or medicinal chemistry required with 0-3 years of relevant industry experience. Academic post-doctoral experience in synthetic/ medicinal chemistry is a plus.Strong track record of scientific innovation and problem solving as evidenced by peer-reviewed publications and/or patents. The candidate must exhibit a deep knowledge of modern synthetic chemistry and analytical techniques.Experience in synthetic method development and target-oriented synthesis. Experience with chemical biology, structure-based drug design, and/or medicinal chemistry is a plus.Self-motivated with excellent interpersonal, organizational and communication skills. Must be able to work effectively in a dynamic and collaborative, fast-paced environment.Ability to learn new concepts and skills that support their primary responsibilities in lab.Excellent oral and written communication skills, including accurate record keeping and preparation and delivery of presentations/ reports.Adaptable/ Flexible - willing and able to adjust to multiple demands and shifting priorities as well as an ability to meet day-to-day challenges with confidence and professionalism.\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
