Now we see an increasing need to expand our calculation efforts for Carbon Capture applications in both theoretical and practical aspects. To be ready to for our future challenges we believe that connecting our theoretical findings to the laboratories and customer applications is crucial.\n\nPrincipal Tasks\n\n Develop the R&D system design tool for Carbon Capture and VOC application systems to support R&D system development efforts (laboratory performance calculation, mechanical design, connected units’ platform, simulation possibility of new desiccant materials etc.). Utilize our R&D system design and optimization tool for Carbon Capture and VOC applications to categorize customers and identify fields and business cases for potentially new product development. Initiate research efforts in core technology design by Theoretical studies to optimize performance related to specific energy use, sustainability and/or capacity Prototype design and testing to verify the potential of the new core technology Analyze our Carbon Capture products with respect to sustainability and derive technical and economic statistics for sustainability effects in product development. Develop a competitor analysis tool on calculated rotor performance.\n\n\nProduct scope: Carbon Capture and VOC applications.\n\nInterfaces and stakeholders: PMC, R&D, Product Management, Sustainability.\n\nCommunication skills: fluency in English\n\nMinimum educational and experience requirements: Master degree in relevant field of engineering (physics or chemical engineering), minimum three years’ of relevant work experience. A doctoral degree within the fields of chemical engineering or engineering physics is a merit.\n\nThe Ideal Candidate Would\n\nHave experience and interest from research in the field of process optimization, advanced process calculations, programming and sustainability.Have three to four years of experience with modelling software development in C++ or C#.Take initiatives and responsibility within his/her field.Be innovative (personality) to lead the development in a new field for Munters AirTech.Be a team player who like to work very tight in smaller teams with deadlines to keep.Be a doer that is comfortable with delivering and that has a focus on results.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
