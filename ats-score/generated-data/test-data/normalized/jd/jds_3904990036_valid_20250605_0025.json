Over many years, we gradually evolved from our broadline distributor beginnings into a major paper products manufacturer, today employing nearly 3,000 people and operating eight (8) manufacturing and five (5) warehouse/distribution facilities strategically located throughout the United States. We’re still family owned and operated, still manufacturing our products in the good old USA and still providing our customers with the same reliable service and quality products they’ve come to expect from AJM for nearly 65 years now. It’s a simple formula, no doubt, but you can’t argue with success. Today we’re the nation’s leading manufacturer of private label paper plates, cups and bowls, lunch bags and lawn and leaf bags. \nCareer Development –At AJM, we realize we will only go as far as our employees can take us and, for that reason, we invest millions of dollars every year on both classroom and on-the-job training to develop our employees’ skills and promote a culture of learning and continuous improvement.
