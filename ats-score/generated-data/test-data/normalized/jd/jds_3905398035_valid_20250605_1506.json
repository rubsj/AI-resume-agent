Reads, tabulates and interprets recordings. Incumbents perform electroencephalograph tests under the direction of physicians. Incumbents must be familiar with the electro-mechanical operation of electroencephalograph equipment and be able to make minor repairs and adjustments. Performs related duties as required.\n\nDUTIES & ESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS: NOTE: The following are the duties performed by employees in this classification, however, employees may perform other related duties at an equivalent level. Not all duties listed are necessarily performed by each individual in the classification.\n\n Attaches electrodes to prescribed areas of the cranium; determine type of electrodes most suited to particular patient. Check calibration signals and electrode resistance and makes adjustments as necessary to obtain satisfactory tracings. For evoked potential recordings, obtains perceptual thresholds; selects channels for recording; and sets stimulus intensities. From Dictaphone or Stenorette, types EEG and evoked potential reports and summaries dictated by the Neurologist; verifies appropriate billing procedures; and maintains files and records of all electroencephalograms and evoked potential recordings. Interviews patients for significant episodes in medical history, such as previous head injuries, nervous disorders, or epilepsy; calms nervous or upset patients. Observes patient throughout the test and notes and records on the patient’s tracing any aberrations produced mechanically by blinking, swallowing, or flexing muscles. Performs minor maintenance and repairs of electroencephalographic and evoked potential equipment; removes or dismantles more complex parts of the equipment and sends them to factory for repair; orders supplies and equipment. Records, identifies, interprets and evaluates the quality of the tracings before sending the electroencephalogram or evoked potential recording to the requesting physician.\n\nQualifications\n\nEducation: Completion of a six-month training period leading to the demonstrated independent operation of evoked potential equipment.\n\nMinimum Experience: The equivalent of one year full-time experience as an Electroencephalograph Technician in a hospital, clinic, or physician’s office.\n\nRequired Licenses/Certifications: BLS - Basic Life Support Certification - issued by AHA-American Heart Association.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Entry level",
