The team builds next generation AI and Search platforms for the bank, enabling smart virtual assistants across multiple channels and platforms. This position requires candidate to be well versed with various machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques, including LLM and Generative AI techniques. Role offers an opportunity to work with seasoned architects, PhDs in Machine Learning and NLP, Software Engineers, and Risk Management partners. Candidate should be able to work independently and collaboratively to take ownership of prepare models for validation and monitoring. Candidate must possess passion for machine learning and data analysis, creatively solving how to assess risk, conduct and summarize research, and prepare technical white papers to support Machine Learning and Software Engineers through the model development lifecycle. This role is unique, in that candidate must be 100% AI Risk Management (50% Research and Quantitative Analysis, 25% Development, and 25% White Paper Documentation).\n\n Required Skills \n\n Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, or related field Knowledge of machine learning and related techniques Knowledge of recent developments in AI space including but not limited to transformers, LLMs, Generative AI Good understanding of a version control system like git to be able to efficiently collaborate with colleagues. Strong Python development skills and knowledge of Java/C++ Adept at leveraging ML/AI techniques to solve critical business problems with good understanding of Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning. Excellent interpersonal communication skills for tech, business, and risk conversations Good analytical skills to break down requirements, solve complex problems, and challenge the approach, build, and test of AI models and model components\n\n\n Skills \n\nPython, Data science, Data, java, Algorithm, risk management, artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Predictive modelling, Data analysis, Predictive analytics\n\n Top Skills Details \n\nPython, Data science, Data, java Algorithm, risk management, artificial intelligence\n\n Additional Skills & Qualifications \n\nThere will be a heavy research and analysis component to this job, especially around risk management related to artificial intelligence and GenAI. They will be diving into an understanding of the biases of AI and the algorithms created by other data scientists on the team, how the data flows through the algorithm, and the risks associated to the outcomes. They'll be developing their own algos a smaller percentage of their time, but need to have a strong background in Python to be able to read the code of the 18 existing AI models and their architecture. They'll be spending a lot of time trying to break what exists and raising questions around why certain things were done that way. From a documentation perspective, they'll need to be able to create graphical representations of their findings so a lay person could understand them.\n\n About TEKsystems \n\nWe're partners in transformation.
