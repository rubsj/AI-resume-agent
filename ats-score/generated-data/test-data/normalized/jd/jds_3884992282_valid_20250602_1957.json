Are you interested in all things Generative AI? Do you enjoy leading teams and developing people? Yes? We have just the right role for you.\n\nStartups are the large enterprises of the future. These new companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and to challenge the status quo to address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. Many of the most interesting companies being created today are at the cutting edge of building Generative AI applications.\n\nThe AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is comprised of customer-obsessed technical experts who spend their time helping these early stage startups as they build their businesses. The team makes sure that these companies can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so. As well as working with these customers directly, members of this team also work with key startup influencer and investor groups, such as VC funds, and incubators or accelerators.\n\nThe customers you and your team will work with are some of the most exciting startups in the world; specifically those who are creating new applications and business models with Generative AI at the core.\n\nWe are looking for a technical leader, passionate about building a high-performing team of customer-obsessed Solutions Architects. Your experience as a technologist will enable you to create a compelling technical vision for your team and its customers. Your experience managing teams of technical builders will allow you to hire and develop a team of world-class architects.\n\nYou’ll engage with a host of other AWS leaders as you work with your team members to build plans that define how we will help early stage Generative AI startups. These plans will encompass both one-to-one engagements with specific customers as well as broadening your team’s impact via one-to-few or one-to-many engagements involving multiple customers. You’ll also work with other AWS teams such as marketing and training to define how your team will contribute to scaled activities such as technical content creation or public speaking.\n\nMany of our innovations and product improvements are driven by customer feedback: you’ll develop and use mechanisms that ensure the insights your team gains from their engagements with customers are delivered to relevant service engineering teams so that we can keep improving our products and make sure they continue to be relevant to early stage startups.\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\n Hire, on-board, train, and develop Solutions Architects from internal and external sources Develop mechanisms to ensure your team is well-positioned to deliver high value to customers and the right results for the business Maintain a high bar for operational excellence; define and maintain appropriate cadences for inspecting the business in your area Own the talent management strategy and outcomes for your team (performance management, promotion pipelines, leadership development, mentoring programs etc.,) Work with peers in Account Management and Business Development functions to develop comprehensive engagement plans that meet the needs of startup customers in your area Act directly as a technical executive sponsor for our most critical accounts Champion your area’s customer needs with senior leaders (Director, VP) inside AWS\n\nAbout The Team\n\nInclusive Team Culture\n\nHere at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.\n\nWork/Life Balance\n\nOur team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.\n\nMentorship & Career Growth\n\nOur team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.
