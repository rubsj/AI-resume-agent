We conduct and coordinate original research into emissions datasets with unusual potential to rapidly drive emissions reductions at scale, then help implement those reductions. Our best-known innovation is Automated Emissions Reduction (AER), the technique currently used by over 600 million devices daily (e.g. all Nest thermostats, U.S. iPhones, Toyota EVs, etc.) to slash their carbon footprints. We also develop and share other techniques, like our Emissionality technology, that more and more wind and solar farms are using to multiply their environmental impact. \nWattTime is also the secretariat of Climate TRACE, a joint initiative of over 100 nonprofits, tech companies, universities, and individual researchers pooling their expertise in AI, remote sensing, and emissions data to collectively build a highly advanced comprehensive open global greenhouse gas measurement system.
