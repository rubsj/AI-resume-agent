The brain and other organs communicate by secreting thousands of proteins that travel throughout the body and activate receptors on target cells, forming a biological communication network. While some secreted proteins, such as leptin, have been deeply studied, the majority remain poorly characterized because existing tools are inadequate to study the entire secretome. For this project, we will use newly developed technology to better understand how distal tissues communicate with the brain and to better deliver synthetic proteins for research and therapeutic applications.\n\nWe are looking to hire a curious, motivated, highly organized research assistant seeking experience in cutting-edge technology development and eager to make discoveries with molecular and synthetic biology techniques. During this project, you will gain experience in pooled screening techniques including library cloning, CRISPR screening, protein purification, proteomics and sequencing. We will use Python and Bash scripting to analyze and visualize large-scale biological datasets. You will be directly mentored by a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Josh Tycko, providing exposure and advice for the research career track. You will benefit from the rich environment of postdocs, graduate students, and other researchers in the Greenberg Lab. This position is ideally suited for individuals seeking to launch a career in scientific research.\n\nBasic Qualifications\n\n\nCollege background or equivalent work experience in a related discipline1+ years of experience\n\nAdditional Qualifications And Skills\n\n\nExperience working with mice or human cell culture models preferred. Strong preference will be given to candidates that can commit for two years. Prior research experience and a background in quantitative course work is desirable. At least one year related work experience (relevant course work may count towards experience). Demonstrated abilities in laboratory techniques helpful, especially cloning, PCR, library preparation, next generation sequencing, flow cytometry, imaging, tissue culture, and protein purification, although we expect to teach all of these while executing projects. Exposure to applicable computer technologies, including specific software applications, may be required. Appropriate communications skills required. May be required to lift, move and transport related laboratory equipment. May be required to work with a variety of hazardous materials. \n\nWhile prior laboratory experience is helpful, most important is a candidate with curiosity, work ethic, motivation to make discoveries, clear organization and notetaking, the ability to learn new techniques, and an excellent track record in college. We expect to teach the genomics, molecular biology, and neuroscience approaches that will be used. This is an ideal position for a recent college graduate interested in preparing for graduate school; we have a strong track record in preparing research assistants to matriculate in competitive PhD programs and support them during the application process. Members from groups underrepresented in STEM are especially encouraged to apply.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nThis is a 12-month term appointment with the possibility of renewal contingent on funding.\n\nOffer contingent upon successful completion of a pre-placement medical evaluation.\n\nThe health of our workforce is a priority for Harvard University. With that in mind, we strongly encourage all employees to be up-to-date on CDC-recommended vaccines.\n\nPlease note that we are currently conducting a majority of interviews and onboarding remotely and virtually. We appreciate your understanding.\n\nThe Harvard Medical School is not able to provide visa sponsorship for this position.\n\nNot ready to apply?
