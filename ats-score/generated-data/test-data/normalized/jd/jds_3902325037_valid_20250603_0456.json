Watch as our colleagues explain 5 reasons to work with us. As one team of 100,000+ colleagues, we share a common set of values - Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement - working together to accelerate research, solve complex scientific challenges, drive technological innovation and support patients in need. #StartYourStory where we value diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nLocation/Division: Asheville, NC Laboratory Products Division\n\nHow will you make impact?\n\nThis key role will be based in Asheville, NC, a unique outdoors focused community with vibrant arts culture and diverse culinary scene. You will work within our Laboratory Products Group in the Controlled Temperature Technologies (CTT) Business Unit and be immersed in a collaborative culture working to deliver the refrigerated lab equipment that our customers need to achieve their cold storage requirements. As a refrigeration engineer in the R&D group you will work in partnership with global multi-functional teams (electrical, mechanical, user experience, manufacturing, quality, sourcing) during all phases of the new product development (NPD) process to design innovative, high quality, reliable refrigerated products.\n\nWork with New Product Development (NPD) team members to develop the refrigeration systems for cold storage products, including -86C Cascade and conventional systems with setpoints from 5C to -40C. Design refrigeration systems to achieve high quality, low energy, long term reliability, target cost, manufacturability and serviceability while meeting regulatory and customer requirements. Develop specifications for system-level, subsystem and component performance based on product requirements. Analyze the thermal behavior of the refrigeration system to include all heat & mass transfer mechanisms, fluid flow, and phase changes by use of predictive thermal fluid modeling and other thermo-physical tools Develop the optimal design through Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), Tradeoff Analysis, Technology Assessment, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) Create and implement test plans to validate the performance of newly developed refrigeration systems by using design for reliability tools and performance sensitivity analysis. Lead innovative advanced technology projects that will support future NPD projects and / or intellectual property. We integrate innovative new technology and intellectual property into our designs as we develop future exciting products! \n\nHow will you get here?\n\nEducation\n\nBachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Physics, or related engineering degree from an accredited higher learning institution with course work in thermodynamics, heater transfer and fluid mechanics preferred.\n\nExperience\n\n5+ years of proven experience in the design, selection, and evaluation of refrigeration systems and components Thermal system modeling and design; Refrigerant properties and selection; Refrigeration testing methods and equipment; Analyzing empirical data for thermal systems; Knowledge of and ability to integrate regulatory and safety requirements into product designs: UL61010, ISO13485, ISO14971, FDA, CE, CSA, NSF456, Energy Star; Use of statistical data analysis in design verification; Strong analytical skills, data interpretation, problem solving and root cause analysis experience; Engineering and Office Software, including EES, and Microsoft Office Suite Project management and phase gate processes; Good documentation practices in drafting test plans, crafting test protocols, and writing engineering reports; Strong written and verbal communication skills; High levels of self-discipline, drive, and a proven record to coordinate personnel in the implementation of design changes; Strong Sense of ownership in projects and work assignments with persistence to overcome project obstacles and drive work to completion; Ability to travel up to 10%.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific is an EEO/Affirmative Action Employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability or any other legally protected status.
