We innovate across the entire AI stack, including at the foundational layer. Our work is built on 3 (and counting) technical breakthroughs from proprietary research that enabled a new type of foundation model with entirely new capabilities.\nWe are seeking a technical engineer with broad skills to join our mission as we push the boundaries of what’s possible today, specific to visual pattern reasoning. You will conceptualize, build, maintain, and operate systems that discover novel insights about the physical world, which translates into billions in savings for our customers.\nWho we areOur team is composed of AI pioneers and leaders from Google X, Google Brain, and Unity. Several of us are repeat founders, with deep commercialization insights across multiple enterprise segments. We enjoy long, deep ideations around entirely unexplored AI use cases in the Earth Sciences. \nLocationWithin 3 hours in time zones from CA.\nWhat you’ll work onExpect to multi-task across:Building out a new data analytics product targeting large enterprises, with rigorous requirements for product specificationsDevelop, train, and optimize multi-modal foundation models on novel objectivesScalable data engineering for large modelsStrategize product designs based on customer insightsBuild and own our go-to-market product\nWho you areCurious: constant urge to learn new thingsNot afraid of leaving your comfort zoneEnjoys research and rapid experimentationCreative: track record of solving hard, unsolved problems\nTechnical skillsBroad technical foundation in software engineering and deep learning (through self-study, practical experience, or PhD)Product: experience with defining, building, and launching new productsProgramming: deep knowledge of PythonML: knows the theory and applied side of deep learning, especially computer vision and foundational model architectures (PyTorch, OpenCV, Tensorflow)Data: experience with distributed data pipelines (Beam/Spark)Backend: experience designing and building scalable and high availability server-side systems (Python, NodeJS, or Golang)Cloud: familiarity with DevOps and infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, GPU scheduling) on cloud (GCP, AWS)Domain specific: spatial data and analytics, geographic information systems \nDay in the lifeExpect to stretch your imaginations daily as we are building a new human interface for information. Expect to learn new skills every day, regardless of the level you’re currently at. We are a small team that support each other. You will work closely with our AI experts but also product engineers. Expect to flex your strategic mind, as you’ll be expected to contribute to both AI and product strategies.\nCompensationCash: $120,000 - $200,000Additional equity compensationBenefits: Comprehensive health, dental, and vision, and life insurance for you and your dependents.\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
