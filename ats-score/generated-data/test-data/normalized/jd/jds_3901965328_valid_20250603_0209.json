This exciting role is a Direct Hire opportunity. Our client is seeking an individual local to their NYC office so they can work in a hybrid model working in office 3 days per week. This position is not offering sponsorship at this time.\n\nJob Summary:\n\nAs the first in-house Senior Full Stack Engineer, you'll assume a critical role in shaping the vision of delivering high quality, AI-generated content to the organizations users through bespoke user experiences. You will take charge of the client web application, ensuring it remains responsive, intuitive, and flexible to allow for rapid product development. Your expertise will extend to integrating essential third-party services, including payment and authentication systems, which are vital for a seamless user experience. Additionally, you'll oversee the development of our internal content management and quality assurance systems, which are pivotal for teaching LLMs, fostering a symbiotic relationship between AI and human editorial expertise.\n\nYour responsibilities will also extend to the Django-based backend, where your continued development will ensure scalable and efficient data handling. Your role is key to facilitating the organizations mission: to distill complex, voluminous data into clear, impactful insights, supporting the commitment to precision and clarity in an era of information overload. The motto is “no data vomit,” and believe big data doesn’t have to reveal itself to provide meaningful insights.\n\nThey are looking for a candidate who is not just technically proficient but also aligns with the ethos of blending technology with human insight, someone who understands the value of data integrity and the impact of the organizations work in computational journalism that drives real-time decision making. They do not want their client-facing platform to become just another news wire or reader, but instead they aim to develop user experiences that enable seamless engagement with dense AI-driven content, and your experience as a front end engineer and your eye for good design are essential in getting them there.\n\nAs the team continues to grow, the Senior Full Stack Engineer will be in a natural position to become a leader at Applied XL and one day lead a team of their own.\n\nResponsibilities:??\n\n Lead the development, optimization, and maintenance of the client-facing web application, ensuring robust, clean, and efficient user experiences both on desktop and mobile. Implement responsive, accessible, and aesthetically intuitive user interfaces with React, HTML and CSS, adhering to the best practices and latest web standards. Assume ownership of the Django backend and help optimize microservices to ensure highly reactive user experiences as their content catalog across data domains continues to grow. Integrate and manage a suite of AWS services to enhance application performance, scalability, and reliability, ensuring seamless deployment and operation. Rapidly deploy internal tooling that streamlines the improvement of internal processes, such as managing taxonomies, improving LLMs, and content management & quality assurance; ensuring they support the dynamic needs of computational journalism. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and deploy new features, while also identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks and ensuring the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs with roles including but not limited to designers, data scientists, support engineers, and content editors. Oversee the integration of third-party services such as payment gateways and authentication systems, ensuring secure, efficient, and seamless user interactions. Advocate for and implement best practices in software engineering, including code reviews, continuous integration, and automated testing, to maintain high code quality and facilitate agile development. \n\nRequired Skills and Experience:?\n\n Demonstrated ability to work independently and make informed, strategic decisions. Proven track record of taking existing systems and elevating their performance, demonstrating clear improvements in efficiency and output. Proficient in at least Javascript and Python as well as React, Redux, Django and lightweight API frameworks. Proficiency building cloud-first systems using AWS or GCP-equivalent cloud services, such as ECS/kubernetes, RDS, DynamoDB, lambda, messaging queues, logging/observability solutions and more. Experience with AI services is certainly a plus. Proven experience as a Full Stack Engineer with a strong portfolio demonstrating expertise in React, Redux, HTML, and CSS. (we’d love to see it!) Fluent in SQL as well as experience with no-SQL and vector databases. Experience with graph databases is a plus. Experience in integrating and customizing third-party APIs, payment systems, and authentication platforms within a full-stack environment. Adept at working in an agile environment, demonstrating a proactive attitude and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced setting. Excellent communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical team members and stakeholders. A strong commitment to continuous learning and staying in the loop with the latest web development trends and technologies. CI/CD mindset. Experience developing test suites with Jest and Cypress or other front end frameworks that test functionality, integration, end-to-end, performance and cross browser compatibility.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Entry level",
