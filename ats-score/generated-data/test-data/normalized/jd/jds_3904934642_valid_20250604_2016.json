We're building AI-powered search and analysis tools to make the patent process less painful and more effective for R&D organizations, inventors, prosecutors, and litigators. Our core product, Patentbreaker, is a groundbreaking 102/103 prior art search tool that automates the generation of claims charts for inter-partes reviews.\n\nLeading companies and law firms are already seeing huge efficiency gains from our beta tools, and we were able to monetize a couple weeks into deploying. But this is just the beginning - our vision is to leverage AI, rich data, and scalable analysis to drive smarter R&D investment decisions across industries. The patent system today is overwhelmed by the explosion of filings, fragmented across service providers, and inaccessible to many inventors. We're here to change that. Our early traction has been incredible, with hundreds of users, a growing enterprise waitlist, and key advisors bought into our mission. Recently, we raised a seed round from top Silicon Valley VCs and angel investors.\n\nWe're a tight-knit, ambitious team of experts in NLP, patents, and product development. Weâ€™re incredibly customer obsessed, work in the office 5-6 days a week, and ship on tight timelines. We are a mix of research and product in our work, and seek to find members of our team that are excited by both in a burgeoning industry.\n\nThe opportunity is huge, the problem is urgent, and the team is top-notch. If you're an exceptional full-stack/backend engineer who wants a high-impact role at a fast-moving AI startup, we'd love to chat.
