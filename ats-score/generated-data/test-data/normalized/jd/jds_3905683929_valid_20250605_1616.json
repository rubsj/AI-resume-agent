Compute power requirements of Augmented Reality require custom silicon. The Meta Silicon team is driving the state of the art forward with breakthrough work in computer vision, machine learning, mixed reality, graphics, displays, sensors, and new ways to map the human body. Our chips will enable AR devices where our real and virtual world will mix and match throughout the day. We believe the only way to achieve our goals is to look at the entire stack, from transistors, through architecture, to firmware, and algorithms. We are currently seeking a graphics hardware/software architect to support custom graphics pipeline SW enabling for AR/VR systems. As part of the Graphics Hardware team, the candidate will contribute to the development of HW/SW emulation systems, architecture of profiling tools and GFX SW stack optimization. The ideal candidate for this role will have an excellent grasp of the graphics pipeline, SW/HW emulation, system SW architecture and power/performance profiling and optimization. The candidate should have a demonstrated track record of working on new graphics/display pipeline architectures and/or graphics APIs, developing HW/SW emulation platforms and supporting development of GFX SW and profiling tools. Successful candidates are motivated self-starters who are comfortable operating in a cross-functional environment and have a hands-on approach to problem-solving.\n\nAR Graphics HW/SW Co-Design Architect Responsibilities:\n\nWork on end-to-end problems and enable GFX HW/SW co-development and optimization around product use cases and system constraintsClosely work with SW teams across the entire graphics stack to enable graphics pipeline features and architect power/performance profiling tools for AR graphics pipelineCollaborate closely with the graphics, system architecture and SW teams to develop HW/SW emulation platforms for GFX SW stack developmentSupport all phases of Silicon development from a SW enabling perspective - from early definition on through specification, architecture and productization\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nB.S. in Computer Science or related fields5+ years of experience working on graphics hardware pipelines and SWExperiencing in developing tools and enabling performance analysis and optimization (CPU/GPU profilers and trace analyzers)Experience with developing and/or using HW/SW emulation systemsProven programming skills and experience of C/C++, compilers, or shaders\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\nExperience with graphics APIs (Vulkan, Direct3D, OpenGL, etc.)Experience with shader languages (HLSL/GLSL) and shader development including performance and power optimizations in the hardware.Experience evaluating architectural tradeoffs in performance, power and image qualityExperience working with UX and Content Design teams in developing graphics applications, 3D assets and effects and optimizing hardware for them.Experience with 2D/3D game engines (Unity, Unreal, Skia)\n\nAbout Meta:\n\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible todayâ€”beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.\n\nMeta is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
