We recognized that PEOPLE are PEOPLE and should be treated as such. That means that while someone not having the college degree specific to business or the 2 - 5 years of experience in sales may not look they best, they may have more to offer than just a piece of paper in a RESUME. \nAs our founder is a native to Las Vegas, he recognized that there were a lot of job opportunities that solely focused on the hospitality and serving industry, which made it challenging to grow and advance in a career without being capped. \nThat’s why a majority of our team comes from a background in hospitality, athletics or something where “ people interaction” is essential. It’s for this reason, our team sees value in hiring candidates that have a background in: \nServing, Cocktail Waitressing and BartendingDay Club / Night Club WorkPlayed High School, Collegiate and / or Professional AthleticsWere apart of Fraternity / Sorority / Extra-curricular Club and ActivitiesDancing, Modeling and / or Brand Ambassador work \nLas Vegas is a great place to make a living in the hospitality industry. As people grow up here, it provides many opportunities and experiences. In the same light, there is a large group of people who want to leverage this experience however don’t know where to start and want to have a place to grow outside of the industry; this is why our business and company was founded. \nWhat You'll Do:\nSales: learning the skill of “sales” is at the forefront of any business; for anyone that wants to become a business, this is the first skill one must developLeadership Development: Vertical growth within the company is always a positive but we believe that personal growth is what will allow individuals to see themselves grow further in life Collaborative Environment: Our team believes that working together as one is what will allow the team to win as a whole and adding KEY pieces is what creates a strong core Social Impact: We believe giving back is not just a social responsibility but something that we take pride \nWhat We're Looking For:\nAmbition: Someone that can push through challenges when doubt and fear sets in Adaptability: Can connect with a wide range of customers and team membersEmpathy: Wants to “seek to understand” first, rather than be understoodEmpowerment: Has goals to help not only those close themselves but also those they may not have been aware of\nWhat You'll Gain:\nRapid Advancement: Our growth is merit based and solely driven by the work ethic that someone has on their own One on One Training: Specific coaching and goals to go over 1 on 1 development for each of our team members Competitive Compensation: Our team members are rewarded for their performance and we believe that’s the way it should be; if you work harder, you should be compensated more.
