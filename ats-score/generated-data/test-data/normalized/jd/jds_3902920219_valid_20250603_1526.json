We like to think of Louisville as the place where Southern hospitality begins but Midwestern common sense and practicality stick around. It’s a blend of the best of both cultures. And speaking of culture, we’ve long been known for having one of the country’s most dynamic art scenes. Over the past decade, our food scene has caught up, with Louisville becoming recognized as one of the leaders in the farm-to-table movement. Oh, and did we mention bourbon? Mix in with a low cost of living and an ease of getting around. Stir well. Enjoy.\nAbout Columbus:Buckeyes. Bridges. And beer hotels. These are just a few of the things that make our second home, Columbus, Ohio, one of America’s most engaging cities. Home to both the state capital and one of the country’s most storied public universities, Columbus offers a dynamic blend of youthful energy, progressive spirit, and good old-fashioned Midwestern attitude (or lack thereof). Even The New York Times was duly impressed, recently naming Columbus one of their “52 Places to Go” around the world. Our local outpost is smack dab in the middle of the Short North, one of the many vibrant neighborhoods within a few minutes of downtown. We encourage you to come pay us a visit; wearing scarlet and gray is optional.\nAbout Doe-Anderson:You know the cliché about a company being “like a family?” Well, sometimes clichés become clichés because they’re true. In the case of Doe-Anderson, you would be joining an organization that’s been nurturing careers (and the people attached to them) for well over a century. We like to think it’s because you can carve your own path here, supported by management and your peers. We try hard to keep the corporate politics to a minimum and the self-reliance to the max. That may be why almost half our employees are shareholders in the company – and why people tend to stick around nearly three times the ad agency average. There’s something about the place that makes it hard to leave.\nAt Doe-Anderson, we have a long history of creating work that, well, works. To do this, we strive to reflect the world we live in and speak to every day. Building belief in brands begins with believing in and celebrating one another as individual members of a diverse and inclusive team.\nWe will never disqualify a potential team member based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin or veteran or disability status.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
