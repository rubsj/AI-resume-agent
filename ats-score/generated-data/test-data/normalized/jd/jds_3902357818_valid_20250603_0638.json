You must learn the business before you can sell it. The Recruiter role is critical in preparing you for promotion into Account Management and long-term success within the company. On a day-to-day basis, a Recruiter’s main responsibility is to identify the right candidates for our clients’ staffing needs by conducting phone and face to-face interviews through our internal database, job boards, and networking. To find and recommend candidates for positions, our Recruiters must exhibit independent judgment and discretion. In this role, you will improve your business acumen, form a good understanding of technical skillsets and learn how to work with a sense of urgency. While mastering the fundamentals of recruiting, we pair you with an Account Manager who serves as your mentor. The purpose of this relationship is to have a mentor who is invested in your success and will help you grow personally, professionally, and financially. The average promotion takes 6-9 months and is based on merit, not tenure. Account Manager Position Account Managers are the face of our organization. They are responsible for building relationships with hiring managers at Fortune 1000 firms with the goal of making Insight Global their sole staffing services provider. Relationships start through cold calling and networking. Account Managers initially reach out to a prospective client to set up an introductory meeting to learn about their hiring needs and to present our services. They become engrained with the hiring manager by building relationships through meetings, lunches, and out of office events. Account Managers become long-term valued partners to our clients by consistently providing them top-tier talent. We believe that the key to creating a lasting business partnership is through a strong relationship built on trust and unparalleled customer service.
