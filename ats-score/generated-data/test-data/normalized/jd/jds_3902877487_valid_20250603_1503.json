GibsonAI's output is reliable and can be shipped to production without concern for hallucinations, non-existent libraries or bugs. To achieve this we have to be very conscious of the state-of-the-art in generative AI and apply various machine learning techniques and algorithms alongside a large language model.\nGibsonAI also aims to help development teams make sense of the AI landscape by abstracting LLM details, what works and what does not, behind a suite of tools that are easy to use, meet the developer where they love to code and work, every time. Our main customer is a developer and they love working with our tools.\nAs the AI landscape continues to evolve, GibsonAI will determine which is the best LLM for a particular task, when we rely on generative AI versus proprietary models and algorithms and how best to implement AI assisted tools to significantly increase the speed and accuracy of the developer.\nWe are well funded and our team has extensive experience for this endeavor. GibsonAI is a significant innovation over what exists today and we are working fast to be the best in the space.\nRequirements\nMinimum undergraduate degree in Computer Science or a related discipline8-12 years experience hands on codingExperience with mentorship, team leadership or managementComprehensive understanding of RDBMS systems, database design and SQLDesire to build developer tools and frameworks\nTechnical Skills\nAnsibleAWSLarge language models (LLM)MySQL or PostgreSQLPython, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic, pytestUnit / Integration testingUNIX command line\nCore Technical Concepts\n(1) GibsonAI.com / RESTful API\nAt its core, GibsonAI is a complex, but standard, RESTful API implementation. Part of our work is continuing to build a robust Web-based portal that allows developers and teams to interact with their accounts and projects. As an analogy for how to think about this part of the GibsonAI product, think about how Github functions.\n(2) heygibson (Command Line Interface)\nheygibson is a command line interface (CLI) tool that allows developers to interact with GibsonAI and write code on the UNIX command line. It can be fully integrated into the developer's environment and integrated the way pre-existing tools can be. heygibson brings the power of AI assisted coding to the fingertips of the developer.\n(3) IDE Integration\nGibsonAI meets the developer where they love to code. GibsonAI is fully integrated into popular IDE's and code editors like VS Code.\n(4) GibsonAI Micro-LLM\nTo work fast and to understand your context, GibsonAI has developed a robust micro-LLM that runs in your environment. Our goal is to keep your intellectual property safe while allowing you to use the vast set of AI tools available today to write code faster.\n(5) UNIX Command Line\nWe would like you to have a rich understanding of the UNIX command line environment. If you use an IDE for coding, that's perfectly fine. If you are not comfortable setting environment variables, editing bash scripts or executing commands at a prompt, learning GibsonAI is going to be tough. Our development platform is MacOS, in production we use UNIX. Our CTO codes in vim.\n\nHow We Work\nWe respect that you have a life outside of work and understand that work / life balance is real and matters. We have kids, we understand the stresses of being professional and personal.\nAt work, we are developers that are fascinated by (and disappointed with) the state-of-the-art that AI brings to code writing. We are going to fix that and do so responsibly, with code that works every time. We love to code and now we get to build tools that empower developers to love to code using AI.\nWe take our work product very seriously and beyond wanting to produce good code for ourselves we need to produce perfect code for customers. We unit and integration test everything. We rely on tried-and-true tools and techniques. We want to be the best at this next evolution of developer frameworks and tools.\nBefore joining us we ask that you make sure you love to code. We measure success by how often we ship high quality software that meets customer requests. We know you might be skeptical about this new frontier but we want you to join us to help us decide how to make it work.\n\nInterview Process\nThere will be 1-2 technical interviews. We will ask you to code but there are no take home testsYou will meet with our CEO, CTO, CPO and Lead Front End EngineerWe will check your referencesIf there are other people on the team you'd like to meet, let us know\n\nPeople\nHarish, CEOMike, CTOGordon, CPORomina, Lead Front End Engineering\n\nWhat This is Not\nWe are not full stack developers, this is not a full stack opportunity. This role is specifically building on the back end and working closely with our front end and AI teams.\n\nWhat We Offer\nWe are working on the frontier of generative AI and software development, doing things no other company is. Youâ€™ll be working with a small, highly experienced team building in one of the most important spaces in modern computing. You are going to learn a ton and grow really fast. Your contribution to GibsonAI will be immense, the contribution to your career invaluable.\nBase pay: $175,000 - $250,000 per year + Competitive equity packageThe base pay varies depending on the candidate's geographic region, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience, among other factors.Health, vision and dental insurance401k MatchingUnlimited paid time off\nGibsonAI is committed to diversity in its workforce and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
