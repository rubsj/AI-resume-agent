The incumbent serves as a General Engineer in the Office of Science (OS), Division of Product Science (DPS), Engineering Branch. Assignments involve providing comprehensive professional engineering review, analysis, and advice for a variety of difficult problems and issues.\n\nRequirements\n\nQualifications\n\nApplicants must meet the following eligibility requirements to participate in this Recent Graduate Program: A. Completed all requirements for an associates, bachelors, masters, professional, doctorate, vocational, or technical degree or qualifying certificate from an accredited educational institution within the 2 years preceding the closing date of this announcement. -OR- B. Released or discharged from active duty within the previous two years by 04/22/2024, where as a veteran who, due to a military service obligation, was precluded from applying to the Recent Graduate Program during any portion of the 2-year eligibility period following completion of degree or certificate requirements, are entitled to a full 2-year period of eligibility upon release or discharge from active duty. In no event, however, may the eligibility period extend beyond 6 years from the date on which the preference eligible veteran completed the requirements of the degree or certificate. -OR- C. Individuals who are expected to graduate with a qualifying Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate, professional, vocational or technical degree or certificate program by 06/30/2024. Current students must meet all eligibility and qualification requirements before a final offer can be made. NOTE: You must submit transcripts or official documentation to verify your eligibility under the Recent Graduate Program. Transcripts MUST reflect the degree/certificate program and the degree conferred date. If your degree/certificate has not been conferred, you must provide proof of the anticipated graduation date. Selectee's entry on duty date will be upon degree conferment. In addition to the eligibility requirements for the Pathways Recent Graduate Program, you must also meet the following Individual Occupational Requirements by 04/22/2024 in order to qualify for the General Engineer, 0801 positions. A. Degree: Engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by ABET; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.-OR- B. Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following: 1. Professional registration or licensure -- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT)1, or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test -- Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE)2 examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. 3. Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in the basic requirements under paragraph A. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program as described in paragraph A. 4. Related curriculum -- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a bachelor's degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. (The above examples of related curricula are not all-inclusive.) In addition to meeting the Individual Occupational Requirements above, you must also meet the OPM Qualification Requirements listed below by 04/22/2024 in order to qualify for the General Engineer, 0801, at GS - 7/9. For GS-7: A. Applicants must have at least one full year of specialized experience, equivalent to at least the GS-05 level in the Federal service which includes interpreting or reviewing scientific data. -OR- B. Completion of one year of graduate level education related to the position being filled (Engineer) from an accredited college and/or university. -OR- C. A bachelor's degree as described in the Basic Qualification Requirements above AND meet Superior Academic Achievement provision (S.A.A.) criteria (visit the site for more detail information). S.A.A. is based on (1) class standing, (2) grade-point average, or (3) honor society membership. -OR- D. Have a combination of experience as described in \"A\" above and education as described in \"B\" above, that when combined equals 100% of the total requirements. -OR- E. Have an engineering bachelor's degree AND have appropriate specialized experience as an Engineering Technician; -OR- F. Have successfully completed a 5-year program of study of at least 160 semester hours leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering. For GS-9: A. Applicants must have at least one full year of specialized experience, equivalent to the GS-07 grade level in the Federal service which includes preparing scientific progress reports, presentations or conducting analysis. -OR- B. Have 2 years of years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a master's degree in Engineering or master's or equivalent graduate degree; -OR- C. Have a combination of superior academic achievement AND one (1) year of appropriate specialized Engineering experience; -OR- D. Have successfully completed a 5-year program of study of at least 160 semester hours leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering AND have one (1) year of appropriate professional Engineering experience.
