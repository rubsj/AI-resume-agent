I know the PE company well as I’ve been networking with them for years (kudos to the TA Director for helping me get into recruiting!) and have just heard absolutely amazing things about both the PE company and all of its portfolio companies. So I’m really pumped to finally have a chance to partner with one of their portfolio companies!!!\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity to join a rapidly growing organization and immediately make your mark! Reporting directly to the CFO, you’ll be his right-hand person for all things finance and product costing related. He’s really looking for someone to come in, create and improve processes, and then delegate down. You’ll be overseeing two cost analysts so it’s a great opportunity to cultivate your people management skills. Huge focus on work/ life balance and flexibility, with a CEO who the CFO describes as “inspiring and impactful.”\n\nI would take a straight cost accountant looking to pivot into more of a finance role or a manufacturing finance professional with strong cost accounting knowledge.\n\nIf you’re interested in hearing more, please reach out!
