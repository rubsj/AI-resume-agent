This technology dramatically changes the metal AM industry by providing immediate component certification and early cancellation of defective builds.  The Phase3D headquarters is in Chicago, located 5 miles from the Chicago Loop. We work closely with federal scientists and engineers to develop machine vision technology for additive manufacturing (camera and software based). We have established research partnerships with multiple national laboratories, US departments, NASA, and research institutions. About Phase3D Culture: Phase3D is currently a small team, comprised of independent thinkers, working to solve challenges in software development, data analysis, mechatronics, electrical engineering, and computer engineering. We are a cross-disciplined group and are excited to be pioneers in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence and machine learning for 3D printing. This is a fast-paced, startup work environment, but with the resources and facilities of a US national Laboratory. This means a lot of variability of workflow and responsibilities, with an emphasis on creative problem solving. You will have the chance to be a part of a team making headlines in the 3D printing world. About the Role: We are looking for a candidate with a well-rounded set of skills to support Phase3D’s Product engineering, delivery and installation, sensor building, and project management. This role will incorporate a mix of fast paced operations engineering, hardware engineering and installation work, and some travel to 3D printing sites such as NASA, the US Air Force, DOE national labs, in addition to management and foresight of ongoing and future projects to mature the readiness level of Phase3D technology. Operations Engineering· Site visits with partner institutions (NASA, Argonne Lab, Oak Ridge Lab, the US Air Force, etc.)· Manage and troubleshoot installations at partnering research facilities · Identify part-compromising defect signatures and support customer value creation· Travel up to 50% (enforced maximum) in first year of role · Build preparation for 3D printing· Building sensor packages and basic circuitry· Remote system maintenance· Managing inventory and shipping, maintain inventory board· Developing written standard operating proceduresHardware Engineering· CAD of sensor fixtures· Electrical drawing of circuitry· Development of packaging and shipping strategyProject Management· Communicating with project stakeholders· Scheduling and performing trainings· Managing milestone delivery for large programs\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
