The ideal candidate will have a passion for continual improvement, automation tools, and building the next-big-thing. We need an enabler (force multiplier) and someone who asks questions, rather than an order follower. Preferred skills are Cloud developing and deploying serverless applications and infrastructure, using NodeJS and terraform. In this role, you will work collaboratively with the software engineering teams to automate the creation of cloud resources and software artifacts, automate the testing of those artifacts, and then automate the deployment and automate monitoring of the applications running in the cloud. You will also troubleshoot issues with infrastructure-as-code, the cloud network, and deployment of cloud resources. Note that this is NOT an SRE or traditional infra admin role.  Duties:Developing and testing new features for the enterprise cloud platform and participating in code reviews for the platform.Assist multiple software development teams with building and deploying cloud-native applications and infrastructure via IaC.Automate the creation of new cloud resources, with monitoring built in.Promote Cloud, Security and DevOps best practices and DevOps culture.Deliver solutions in a complex private and public hybrid cloud environment including distributed systems that are resilient and highly available.\nMust Haves:Bachelor’s degree or the equivalent in Computer Science, Information Technology, Engineering. 4+ years developing, deploying, and monitoring cloud native solutions (AWS & Azure are the preferred), with a focus on Infrastructure-as-code tools, preferably Terraform.Experience developing and deploying cloud-native services and writing unit tests for NodeJS, Java or other high level programming language.Experience building highly resilient cloud eco-systems capable of high availability at scale and integrating cloud and SaaS tools using IaC.Self-motivated, self-driven attitude and experience working in a fast-paced environment.Ability to translate business requirements into a solution architecture.Ability to discuss and promote cloud best practices.Experience working on large cross-functional teams.Experience building proof-of-concepts to validate new tools and architectures.Proven experience of having a strong automation and continuous improvement mindsetExcellent communication skills.
