NYSIF's mission is to guarantee the availability of workers’ compensation insurance at the lowest possible cost to New York employers and to provide timely, appropriate indemnity and medical payments to injured workers, while maintaining a solvent fund. Since inception, NYSIF has fulfilled the dual roles for which it was created: to compete with other carriers to ensure a fair marketplace and to be a guaranteed source of coverage for employers who cannot secure coverage elsewhere.\n\nNYSIF is the largest workers’ compensation carrier in New York State and among the top ten largest workers’ compensation carriers in the nation, insuring approximately 131,000 policyholders, with more than $1.6 billion in annual earned premium and over $22 billion in assets. A self-supporting insurance carrier, NYSIF operates without taxpayer funding.\n\nIn addition to workers’ compensation insurance, NYSIF provides disability benefits coverage for off-the-job injuries to more than 57,500 New York employers. In 2018, NYSIF added paid family leave as a component of its disability benefits product, providing New Yorkers with job-protected, paid time away from work to care for their families.\n\nNYSIF Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nThe New York State Insurance Fund (NYSIF) prioritizes and champions diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) throughout our agency.
