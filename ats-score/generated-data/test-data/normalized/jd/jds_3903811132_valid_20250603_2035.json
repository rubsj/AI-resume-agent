Having gone through the devastating results of a hack, we knew that we needed to do something about it.\nSince the early beginnings of our industry, over $10B have been lost to preventable hacks, while in July 2023, there were over 33 hacks in a single month!\nAbout the RoleAs the first Research Engineer in our team, you will spearhead the research and development of the Network. Your role will be critical in shaping our protocol strategy, designing a secure and efficient mechanism, and guiding its evolution.\nResponsibilitiesRefine, simulate, and define the parameters of the Network mechanism that enables hack prevention on any integrated L2.Lead the decision-making on the tech stack that we will use to implement the mechanism (e.g., app-rollup vs app-chain, Cairo vs Solidity, etc.). Choose the appropriate off-the-shelf technologies that are required for the mechanism.Lead the implementation, maintenance, and security (e.g., audit coordination) of the protocol.Collaborate with other team members to integrate Network with existing infrastructure.Stay up to date on the latest developments in security and blockchain development (e.g., Foundry, etc.)Create and maintain technical documentation for internal and external use.\nAbout youExperience researching and designing complex onchain mechanisms and onchain protocols.Light mathematical background that can support the simulation and definition of the mechanism’s parameters.Experience with protocol engineering and development tools.Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to think analytically.You are deeply involved in the crypto space.\nNice to HavePrior experience in a fast-paced startup.Experience in implementing complex smart contracts with high TVL.Experience in leading the Security of a protocol, including the management of audits and other OpSec activities.\nWhy join usBe part of the Founding team.Work on one of the most challenging topics in web3.Be the owner of your project and build it from the ground up.Deeply impactful work for the entire industry.You’ll join a team that appreciates and embraces shitposting.\nWhat we offer\nFlexible PTOHealth InsuranceMajor industry conferences and events coveredRemote-first, with a hub in NYC\n\nExperience Level (if available): None",
