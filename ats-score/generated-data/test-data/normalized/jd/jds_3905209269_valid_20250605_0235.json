Backed by Cisco Systems, we provide Internet service in over 216 markets globally. We were once a startup funded by venture capital. And while we have matured into a stable, publicly traded ( NASDAQ: CCOI) company, we’ve retained our startup mentality—transparency in operations, open dialogue among departments, and fresh perspective from our newest employees. We omit titles from our business cards to deemphasize organizational hierarchy and bureaucracy.\n\nThe Sales Organization:\n\nCogent Sales is a group of 600 enthusiastic, fearless professionals who persevere through successes and failures, while continually learning and growing.
