The role will perform research and technical duties for the laboratory. The individual will work closely with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and laboratory manager in a dynamic laboratory environment. The ability to function independently, as well as part of a team, is critical. Excellent organizational and communications skills (both verbal and written) are essential, as is attention to detail.\n\nThe Vanderbilt Biochemistry research laboratory investigates the structural basis for recognition, biochemical function and biological specificity of proteins and nucleic acids. Specifically, we study systems involved in bacterial pathogenesis, cell signaling, and cancer at the molecular level. Rather than focusing on specific techniques, we take a problem-oriented approach and use whichever techniques are necessary to answer the question at hand. Often, this requires complementary application of structural approaches including spectroscopy, scattering, crystallography, and microscopy. The work unit is made up of faculty, research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students.\n\nDuties and Responsibilities:\n\nAssists in Research and Development:\n\nResearches and collects data using appropriate lab experiments, procedures, and techniquesPrimary tasks involve sub-cloning, mutagenesis, and production of DNA vectors for protein expression, large-scale bacterial overexpression and purification of proteins using FPLC and HPLCWrites and updates laboratory protocolsModifies and plans research experiments, procedures, and techniques in optimizing research designSynthesizes, analyzes and interprets data with minimal helpReports on status of research activities in oral and written formatsAssembles and compiles research data for presentation and/or reports\n\n\nMaintenance:\n\nConducts lab space maintenanceSets up, operates, and maintains laboratory equipment including, but not limited to – centrifuges, incubated shakers, FPLC, etc.Proper storage and maintenance of protein stocksAssists with orders and maintenance of inventory and supplies\n\n\nPerforms administrative duties:\n\nOversees and trains research and support staff on equipment operations, technical procedures, and lab maintenanceParticipate in weekly and bimonthly meetings to discuss project progressOther tasks as directed by supervisor\n\n\nQualifications\n\nA Bachelor’s degree in biochemistry, biological sciences, chemistry, or related field from an accredited institution of higher education is necessaryKnowledge and experience with microbiology, bacterial protein expression and purification is preferredKnowledge of chromatography instrumentation is preferredKnowledge and experience with PCR and cloning is preferredKnowledge and experience with mass spectrometry and ligation independent cloning techniques a plusThe ideal candidate would have experience in a structural biology laboratory Experience with organization, inventory, and recordkeeping is preferred\n\n\nCommitment to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\nAt Vanderbilt University, we are intentional about and assume accountability for fostering advancement and respect for equity, diversity, and inclusion for all students, faculty, and staff.
