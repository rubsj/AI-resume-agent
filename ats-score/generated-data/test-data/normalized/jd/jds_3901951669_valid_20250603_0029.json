A successful candidate must be flexible to ensure meeting deliverables for a fast-paced, deadline-oriented project. The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with disabilities.\n\nWho We Are\n\nAIMRL group's research combines biology and robotics to uncover the principles of robustness that make animals so successful at locomotion in natural environments, and, in turn, inspire the design of the next generation of novel robots for effective real-world operation. Specifically, our current work is focused on enhancing autonomy (power, sensing and control) of insect-scale robotic platforms. Our research aims to develop a rich ecosystem of robotic devices that, in the not-so-distant future, will have the potential to benefit human lives in the areas of search and rescue, inspection and maintenance, personal assistance, and environmental monitoring.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be \n\nDesigning, fabricating, assembling, analyzing, and managing custom electronics solutions for microrobot/biohybrid system actuation, sensing and control.Generating manuscripts.Assisting with project proposals.Oversight of the lab.Student Mentoring.Teaching in Workshops/Outreach activities.Project management.\n\nWhat You Should Know\n\nThis fulltime position is appointed in one-year intervals, with re-appointments anticipated in year 2 (contingent on satisfactory performance and funding).\n\nWhat We Can Offer\n\nThe starting salary for this position will be $60,000 annually.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe University of Colorado offers excellent benefits , including medical, dental, retirement, paid time off, tuition benefit and ECO Pass. The University of Colorado Boulder is one of the largest employers in Boulder County and offers an inspiring higher education environment. Learn more about the University of Colorado Boulder .\n\n Be Statements \n\nBe curious. Be game-changing. Be Boulder.\n\nWhat We Require\n\nPhD in Electrical Engineering, Robotics, or closely related field.Expertise in unusual format electronics (large area, distributed, flexible and stretchable) design and fabrication.Expertise in embedded programming.Proficient in Matlab/Python, and other related circuit design tools.\n\nWhat You Will Need\n\nExcellent writing and communication skills.Independent, collaborative, and motivated.Interest in mentoring graduate and undergraduate students.Ability to work with team members from diverse cultural and scientific backgrounds.\n\nWhat We Would Like You To Have\n\nExperience with miniature power electronics.Experience with RF communication and energy harvesting.Experience with designing and fabricating custom sensors.Experience with high-voltage actuation technologies such as piezoelectric, dielectric elastomeric actuators, etc.Experience with mechanical CAD.\n\n Special Instructions \n\nTo Apply, Please Submit The Following Materials\n\nResume/CVCover LetterReference Letter (Optional) Transcripts/Proof of Degree: If you are selected as the finalist, your degree will be verified by the CU Boulder Campus Human Resources Department using an approved online vendor.
