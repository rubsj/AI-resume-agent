Based in Seattle, Fred Hutch is the only National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in Washington.\n\nWith a track record of global leadership in bone marrow transplantation, HIV/AIDS prevention, immunotherapy and COVID-19 vaccines, Fred Hutch has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading cancer, infectious disease and biomedical research centers. Fred Hutch operates eight clinical care sites that provide medical oncology, infusion, radiation, proton therapy and related services, and network affiliations with hospitals in five states. Together, our fully integrated research and clinical care teams seek to discover new cures to the world’s deadliest diseases and make life beyond cancer a reality.\n\nAt Fred Hutch we value collaboration, compassion, determination, excellence, innovation, integrity and respect. These values are grounded in and expressed through the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. Our mission is directly tied to the humanity, dignity and inherent value of each employee, patient, community member and supporter. Our commitment to learning across our differences and similarities make us stronger. We seek employees who bring different and innovative ways of seeing the world and solving problems. Fred Hutch is in pursuit of becoming an anti-racist organization. We are committed to ensuring that all candidates hired share our commitment to diversity, anti-racism and inclusion.\n\nThe laboratory of Dr. Gavin Ha (https://gavinhalab.org) has a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow position open in the Computational Biology Program of the Public Health Sciences and Human Biology Divisions. We are seeking a highly motivated individual who is interested in developing and implementing innovative computational and analytical approaches to study the genetics and epigenetics of cancer from tumor and liquid biopsies. Candidates who are excited about large/complex ‘omics’ data analysis of cancer genomes, computational methods development, and liquid biopsy research are encouraged to apply. The position has a competitive salary and great benefits.\n\nThe Ha Lab develops computational approaches to study cancer genomes from tumors and liquid biopsies, such as circulating tumor DNA. Their goals are to uncover mechanisms of treatment resistance, to identify blood-based genetic biomarkers, and to translate these findings to help improve clinical applications. The lab is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and DoD/CDMRP, including receiving funding from the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award, the Prostate Cancer Foundation, and the V Foundation.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nWe work in an interdisciplinary team environment with many local and external experts. All of our projects involve partnering with investigators who have diverse expertise in molecular and experimental biology, cancer biology, and clinical research. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on transformative and leading-edge research problems in cancer research:\n\nCancer Genome Analysis – study tumor evolution, non-coding genome alterations, genome rearrangements and chromatin organization, cell plasticity, metastatic disease Multi-omic Data Integration –using genome, transcriptome, methylome, and chromatin/epigenetic data modalities to study cancer subtypes, phenotypes, heterogeneity, and resistance to therapy.Liquid Biopsy Analysis and Methods Development – develop new computational methodologies for exploiting liquid biopsies to study cancer and to advance precision oncologyFor examples of recent studies, see PMID:29909985, PMID:29109393, PMID:25060187, PMID:36399432, PMID: 36463275, PMID: 38598634See the lab website for more details: https://GavinHaLab.org/\n\nQualifications\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:\n\nApplicants must have a PhD and/or MD (or equivalent) with training in one of these disciplines:Computational biology, bioinformatics, computer science, data science, statistics, computer/electrical engineering, physics, or other related fields.Experience with cancer data analysisApplicants must have a demonstrated publication track record\nPreferred Qualifications\n\nWorks well in team environments, has strong communication/organization skills and is detail-orientedHighly motivated individual who thinks independently but also enjoys working in a dynamic, collaborative, multidisciplinary teamStrong programming experience (R, Python, Matlab, Java, C/C++, Perl or other languages for research)A background in cancer biologyExperience with analyzing genome sequencing dataExperience with high performance computing environments and cloud computing environments Candidates with strong interest and/or expertise in any of these research areas are highly encouraged to apply:Cancer genomics, liquid biopsies, tumor evolution/heterogeneity Application of statistical modeling, algorithm design, machine learning to study cancer and genetics Analysis of large, complex genome, epigenome, and transcriptome data\nTo Apply, Please Submit Your Application With The Following\n\nCover letter with a statement of research accomplishments and interests Curriculum vitae Two representative publications or preprints (if available)\n\nA statement describing your commitment and contributions toward greater diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism in your career or that will be made through your work at Fred Hutch is requested of all finalists.\n\nThe annual base salary range for this position is from $67,728 to $100,000 and pay offered will be based on experience and qualifications. Relocation offered for those who qualify.\n\nFred Hutchinson Cancer Center offers employees a comprehensive benefits package designed to enhance health, well-being, and financial security. Benefits include medical/vision, dental, flexible spending accounts, life, disability, retirement, family life support, employee assistance program, onsite health clinic, income-based child care subsidy, tuition reimbursement, paid vacation (22 days per year), paid sick leave (up to 30 calendar days per occurrence of a qualifying reason), paid holidays (13 days per year), and paid parental leave (up to 4 weeks).\n\nOur Commitment to Diversity\n\nWe are proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) Employer.
