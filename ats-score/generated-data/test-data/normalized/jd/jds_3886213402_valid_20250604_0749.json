By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, our client is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. our client’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, our client is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.\nWHY WE'RE HERE:The Vehicle Autonomy (Robotics) team at our client develops aerial and ground-based robotic systems. The team is responsible for taking products like Ghost, Anvil, and our Sentry Tower from paper sketches to operational systems. We work in close coordination with specialist teams like Perception, Autonomy, and Manufacturing to solve some of the hardest problems facing our customers. We are looking for software engineers, roboticists, and front-end and mobile developers who are excited about creating a powerful robotics platform that can be tasked and viewed in real-time through a variety of interfaces.We are looking to bring on a Robotics Test and Release Engineer (C++) to build an augmented automated code testing framework for the Robotics team. This person will work with a team that will develop processes & tools that allow our client to develop and release safety critical systems quickly and reliably. A strong Test and Release engineer will have a proven track record of developing CI/CD pipelines and a background in development, operations, and automated test coverage infrastructure, both on-device and in the cloud.\nWHAT YOU'LL DODesign, deploy, and manage automated testing and deployment processes.Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate DevOps best practices into the software development lifecycle.Work directly with one or two teams including our Ghost product to create a release pipeline infrastructure gated on automated tests with high code coverage.Establish and maintain continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.Provide expertise in ensuring high percentage code coverage at the unit, component, and integration test level for a complex, distributed robot system.Drive the adoption of CI/CD by creating reliable process automation pertinent to each product and business line.Monitor and enhance system reliability, performance, and security through the use of metrics.Evaluate emerging technologies to ensure the team stays current with industry trends.\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONSBachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.Proven experience in a DevOps or test engineering role, demonstrating leadership and innovation.Proficiency in C++.Proficiency in scripting languages such as Python, Bash, or PowerShell.Strong expertise in CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis CI, Circle CI).In-depth knowledge of version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN).Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).Solid understanding of networking, security, and system administration.Excellent problem-solving and communication skills.U.S. Person status is required as this position needs to access export controlled data.\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONSExperience implementing automated testing frameworks in a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) environment.Experience with microservice architectures.Familiarity with monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack).Experience with Nix/NixOS.Knowledge of Agile methodologies.\n\nExperience Level (if available): Mid-Senior level",
