The “modern data stack” promises a centralized data platform for powering valuable new applications, from AI-powered products to real-time analytics.\n\nUnfortunately, a big problem stands in the way of most data projects and products – the issue of data quality. Rules-based data quality approaches that worked when data was small and tightly controlled don’t scale. And with more data sources, transformations, and users, quality issues are multiplying fast. The vast majority of issues go uncaught—until they lead to an expensive fire drill.\n\nAnomalo is the automated AI solution that plugs directly into the modern data stack and automatically monitors tables for a wide range of data quality issues. Our software uses unsupervised learning to catch deep problems in the data, like sudden changes in the distribution, that aren’t covered by static rules or basic observability. With built-in root cause analysis, Anomalo shows not only whether data is anomalous but also why and what the impact is. This prevents data issues from reaching dashboards, reports, and products, while data teams spend less time debugging and more time building.\n\nWe’re rapidly growing and work with some of the biggest brands leveraging data today, like Block, Discover Financial Services, Buzzfeed, and Notion. The company has raised a total of $72M seed through Series B funding and is backed by top-tier venture firms like SignalFire, Norwest Venture Partners, Databricks Ventures, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital.\n\nAnomalo is building the platform that data-driven companies need to be able to make good data-driven decisions, and would love to have you join for the ride.\n\nAs a Platform Engineer at Anomalo you’ll have an opportunity to help shape the foundational frameworks and processes that empower your colleagues to deliver value to our customers rapidly and with confidence.
