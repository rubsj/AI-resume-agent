To achieve this we have to be very conscious of the state-of-the-art in generative AI and apply various machine learning techniques and algorithms alongside a large language model.\nGibsonAI also aims to help development teams make sense of the AI landscape by abstracting LLM details, what works and what does not, behind a suite of tools that are easy to use, meet the developer where they love to code and work, every time. Our main customer is a developer and they love working with our tools.\nAs the AI landscape continues to evolve, GibsonAI will determine which is the best LLM for a particular task, when we rely on generative AI versus proprietary models and algorithms and how best to implement AI assisted tools to significantly increase the speed and accuracy of the developer.\nWe are well funded and our team has extensive experience for this endeavor.
