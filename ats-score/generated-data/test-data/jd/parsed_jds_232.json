Success requires consultative, solutions-oriented sales, and customer service skills in addition to intense personal energy and focused activity.

The AE must be expert in identifying business opportunities with customers, developing Enterprise Account Plans, driving execution across functional stakeholders, and closing revenue. The Enterprise Account Executive should be comfortable engaging in business level outcome conversations with the C-suite, presenting Cloudflare’s vision and plan for value creation to all levels, and negotiating win-win scenarios for all parties.
