With a best-in-class product, and more borrowing power than most other lenders can offer, your job at RenoFi is to make it easy for our homeowners to say “YES.” You’ll be responsible for advising Utah homeowners on various renovation financing products and bringing together all the required pieces to help families finance their dream renovations faster. Production will come from a combination of self-sourced and company-generated leads. \nA LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU:\nYou are a seasoned mortgage professional with a wealth of knowledge and are fired up for the opportunity which exists in front of you today. You have renovation lending experience and love the idea of building your business around that pillar. You don’t give the negative headlines a second of your time, because you know that if you plan your work and work your plan, you’ll be successful in this business.\nWHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:\nAs a RenoFi Senior Loan Officer, you’ll have the best of both worlds. You’ll spend your time building referral relationships with contractors, builders, realtors, and other referral sources as well as working 10-15 fresh, exclusive leads per week. Close the traditional loans, then grow both your production and referral base with RenoFi leads. We have a playbook that works and we’re looking for loan officers who are eager to execute. \nWHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR: \nCurrent NMLS license including Utah Lending Manager licenseMinimum two years of mortgage origination experienceExisting knowledge of Renovation loans (Preferred)Construction Lending experience (Preferred)Ability to analyze and comprehend complex financial data and provide mortgage loan options\nRenoFi is committed to building a diverse and inclusive team. We believe various backgrounds and experiences contribute to our mission of transforming the renovation lending industry. If your experience doesn’t perfectly match the requirements, we encourage you to apply anyway and tell us why you’d be a great fit for this role!\nABOUT US:\nThe demand for home renovations has never been stronger, yet, it's surprisingly difficult for a new homeowner to renovate. It can take a decade to build up enough home equity and savings to pay for a major renovation. As a result, recent homeowners do a lot of financially-suboptimal things to compensate like borrow from their 401k, rack up credit card debt, and use high-interest personal loans. Or they just live unhappily for years in a home that doesn't meet their family's needs.\nBut by completing a major renovation, homeowners are increasing the value of their home. Professional real estate investors leverage this After Renovation Value (ARV) to roll the increase in value into new properties all the time. But there hasn't been a great way for homeowners to take advantage of this. If homeowners had an ability to borrow against the ARV, they could increase their borrowing power up to 10x.\nTo meet this need, RenoFi created a platform that enables homeowners to borrow funds from RenoFi approved lenders in the form of the first home equity loan purpose-built for renovations! Unlike standard home equity loans, RenoFi Loans use the value of your home post-renovation which lets you borrow the most money at the best possible terms. RenoFi is creating a full suite of renovation loan products to better suit the needs of today’s homeowners!\nFor homeowners, RenoFi makes it possible to renovate years earlier than might be otherwise feasible. For contractors, we empower the financing of renovations at the point of sale, reducing instances of scope reduction, and ensuring prompt payment. Our lender partners, most often credit unions, rely on RenoFi's platform to generate loans, create efficiencies, and grow membership. The lenders pay RenoFi for the new loans, which allows us to offer our services to homeowners for free. RenoFi is truly a win-win-win for everyone involved.\nRenoFi is backed by some of the best startup investors in the world, including First Round Capital, NYCA Ventures, CMFG Ventures, and Canaan Partners.\nWE ARE A GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED TEAM\nRenoFi has been built from the start as a fully distributed team with an intentional focus on growing a strong team and culture that spans timezones and nationalities. Here's one fun example!\nPlease highlight any prior experience working remotely when applying. US or GMT-adjacent timezones will be prioritized.\nRenoFi offers competitive cash and equity compensation. Some benefit offerings will vary from country to country. In the United States, we offer competitive health and retirement plans.

By training low-income adults to launch and advance careers as software engineers, we help our Fellows go from earning $18,000 to over $90,000 starting salary on average, adding an estimated $2M in lifetime earnings. Pursuit partners with leading companies like Blackstone, USV, Citi, Peloton, and Uber to employ Fellows in career-defining engineering roles and supports them with on-the-job training to ensure potential translates to performance. Since 2013, Pursuit has created ~$1B in total lifetime wage gains, creating lasting economic mobility that spans generations. \nPursuit’s proven solution is built on two interconnected components: training (which includes community development, Core pre-job training, and Commit on-the-job training) and a financial product (known as Bond).
