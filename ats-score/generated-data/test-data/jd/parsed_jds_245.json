If you have read my job descriptions before, you will know that I like to add some humor to these Job Descriptions. If you are new to my Job Descriptions, welcome to the party...I like to add some humor to these things. So, if you see something that gives you a chuckle, that was the intent.\nFor this role, just like just about every role I work on, the social fit is almost as important as the technical fit. You might ask...so, what are those 'social fit' characteristics you are seeking? Well, I am glad you asked. Here are a few:I have done quite a bit of work with these guys over the years, so I know them quite well. They have a high 'hit rate'...by that, I mean they have a high retention rate. They enjoy working with people that don't believe the entire planet revolves around them or individuals who believe their opinion is the only one that matters. So, if you are that kind of person (the ego nut), just go back to being an Instagram Influencer...because we wont have a fit here.Everyone here works well with one another and they ask for your input and ideas. So, don't be shy. If you are applying to this role and have a bunch of Cost Accounting experience, you probably have quite a few lessons learned from your background. Feel free to add your input, they will actually want to hear your thoughts (as long as they aren't 'Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy'...a little chuckle from those that remember SNL from the 90s).\nFor this role, we are seeking a Cost Accountant in Sarasota, Florida. If you are not local to Sarasota, we would need you to relocate to Sarasota. There are no relocation dollars available...so, if you want to relocate, you would need to do that on your own.\nI can only work with US Citizens or Green Card Holders for this role. \nHere is what we are seeking: We are seeking a cost accountant that can engage with the systems that the people you will be collaborating with. From a 'systems' point of view, these guys run NetSuite (I don't need NetSuite experience, however...as long as you have experience with any ERP, that would be great) . From a people perspective, you will be collaborating with Operations, Finance, Engineering, a Plant Superintendent, and Procurement. \nIn terms of expectations, within those first critical 90 days, you will be engaging with your team members, dig into BOMs (nope, they aren't things that blow up), routings for manufactured parts, and look at the way things are vs the way they could be, and doing some plant visits. By the way, their is really only about 10% travel...and it will be planned way ahead of time.\nHere are some of the main responsibilities (I won't bore you to tears with a zillion bullet points...rather, I will include the main ones. I will share the full JD with you when we chat):Analyze, interpret and communicate variances including; PPV, Inventory adjustments, Work Order Variances, Labor and OH variances.Maintain and distribute exception reporting and provide guidance to users for interpretation and correction where needed.Interpret time studies in order to capture accurate labor usage and pay rates within BOM’s and corresponding standard costs.Analyze overhead and landed costs in order to capture accurate overhead and inbound freight costs within BOM’s and corresponding standard costs.Review new part #’s for costing accuracy and help perform updates as needed. Monitor and develop standardized inventory cycle count processes and procedures in order to improve accuracy and detect BOM variance issues.Analyze manufacturing variances by work-order.Reconcile perpetual inventory to the general ledger.Monitor and calculate inventory excess and shrinkage reserves.Monitor and Calculate capitalized inventory variances.Analyze Inter-Company Profit and Eliminations.\nHere is what we are seeking (again, I won't put a ton of bullets here....just the meat):At least 4 years of Cost Accounting experience. That experience should be in a manufacturing environment.Any experience working with ERP Systems. This can be NetSuite, SAP, JD Edwards, or any other ERP (SaaS is preferred, but the world won't fall apart if you don't have a SaaS focused ERP...just as long as you have some ERP experience).Experience of how inventory actually 'behaves' (no, not like a 2 year old throwing a temper tantrum in Target) and impacts that balance sheet and income statement.Experience with that wonderful world of Excel (Pivot Tables, V-Lookup, formulas, etc...)."}
