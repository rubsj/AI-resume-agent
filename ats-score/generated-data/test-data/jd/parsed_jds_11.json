We are in the office 2-3 days a week, with anchor days being Tuesday and Thursdays.\nAbout Us\nReplo helps companies sell on the internet by helping marketing teams automate building and testing customer journeys using AI.\nToday, our beachhead is in ecommerce. Thousands of e-commerce companies, from Hexclad to JIF Peanut Butter, use Replo to build everything from their latest product offers to Super Bowl giveaways.\nHistory\nReplo was founded in the summer of 2021 by Yuxin Zhu and Noah Gilmore. We launched in 2022 and grew to over 1000+ paying customers in just 6 months, with no sales team.\nWe’ve raised over $8.2M from Figma, YCombinator, General Catalyst, Infinity Ventures, MAGIC Fund, Base Case Capital, as well as the founders of NextJS\/Vercel.\nTraction\nWe are default alive, and continue to grow double-digit % every month.\nFounding Team\nYuxin Zhu grew up in New York City and graduated from UC Berkeley (CS ‘15) and prior to Replo ran engineering, product, and design teams at Uber. In his spare time, he likes to listen to audiobooks, play board games, and snowboard in Hokkaido. You’ll find him at his favorite restaurant in Tokyo, Menya Itto.Noah Gilmore grew up in Chicago and also went to Berkeley (EECS ‘15, same dorm as Yuxin!) and prior to Replo was Principal Engineer at Plangrid, a YC company which was acquired by Autodesk in 2019. In his spare time, he likes working on his blog and assortment of iOS apps (you can learn more at https:\/\/noahgilmore.com\/!)\nWhy We Exist\nThe web continues to be the most profitable customer acquisition channel for companies selling services and goods online.Over the last five years, total digital ad spending in the US has more than doubled to $270B, while customer acquisition costs (CAC) have increased over 60%. As competition increases, there are more software platforms and service providers offering analytics and insights than ever before.However, going from this data to actually optimizing customer acquisition remains exceedingly difficult. Marketing teams have to look at numbers, draw the right conclusions, figure out what to test, how to test it, and often wait days or weeks on other stakeholders — including design, copywriters, developers, media buyers — before they can even launch new ideas.This method is extremely costly and exceedingly slow, because human experience, energy, and time is required at every step on the treadmill of refining customer acquisition. We believe data and AI can not only turn the customer acquisition flywheel — it can do so 10x faster, and 100x more cost-effectively than current, human-only methods.That’s what Replo exists to enable.\nBenefits\nWe offer very competitive cash and equity compensation with healthcare\/vision\/dental and 401K. We will also provide a stipend for work-from-home gear if you need!\nYour responsibilities\nDrive adoption, retention, and expansion for a product people love that solves real problems.
