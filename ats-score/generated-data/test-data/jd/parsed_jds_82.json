Pragmatically speaking, we help employers reimburse employees for individual insurance instead of offering a traditional one-size-fits-all group plan. We believe this model can empower employees (when they have the right support) to be savvy healthcare consumers and have a transformative impact on the entire healthcare system.\n\nLet’s be honest—health insurance is usually a confusing, frustrating, and even emotional experience for people. We want to fix that with a new model, great technology, and a superior user experience. We have made a great start, but we need your help to fully realize our long-term vision.\n\nAssociate Account Executive \n\nWe are seeking a self-starting and dynamic Associate Account Executive (AAE) to join our team and focus on qualifying leads for our health insurance products to brokers, as well as close opportunities from our small business segment. As an AAE, you will be responsible for prospecting, qualifying, and nurturing new leads, developing relationships with brokers and benefits consultants, and directly impacting the generation of revenue for our company.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n Identify, prospect and qualify potential leads and set appointments for sales executives through various channels such as phone calls, email, social media, and events.  Build and maintain relationships with employee benefit consultants (or “brokers”) to generate new business and increase revenue.  Work with a region al team selling our platform to the small business segment of companies in your area of responsibility.  Use consultative communication to identify the needs and pain points of brokers and offer our health insurance products as solutions.  Execute strategic outreach campaigns to increase brand awareness and drive sales.  Manage and update the CRM database with accurate and timely information on leads, opportunities, and sales activities.  Collaborate with the sales and marketing team to develop and refine sales strategies and tactics.  Continuously network and keep up-to-date with industry trends and developments. \n\nRequirements\n\n 1-2 years of experience in business , customer service, or sales development (Preferably in a SAAS environment)  Proficiency in CRM software (HubSpot)  Strong verbal and written communication skills  Ability to build and maintain relationships with potential clients and partners  Knowledge of basic sales techniques and strategies  Strong problem-solving and negotiation skills  Time management and organizational skills  Ability to work independently and as part of a team  Flexibility and adaptability to change  A desire to learn and grow in the sales field \n\nWhat It Takes To Join Our Team\n\nAt Take Command, we believe in three key traits that set up a foundation for success in all sales roles within our team:\n\n Coachability  The health insurance industry is complex and constantly changing. We are looking for folks that are not only open to being coached to success, but are able to take feedback and implement it quickly. The attitude of “Feedback is a gift” goes a long way!  Work Ethic  We are big believers in ‘‘Talent is overrated” and that those with True Grit will rise to the top quicker than those with an abundance of talent but fail to put in the necessary time to achieve their potential. You may be familiar with Malcolm Gladwell's “10 000-hour rule,” asserting that the key to achieving true expertise in any skill is simply a matter of practicing, albeit in the correct way, for at least 10 000 hours. Do you have the hunger and desire to get to these 10,000 hours quicker than anyone else?  Attitude  Sales is full of setbacks and there will be more deals that don’t go your way, than close. Feeling comfortable failing with the attitude of “Failure is a stepping stone on the path to success” is what is needed to be successful in any sales role, especially in sales in a startup environment as we continue to learn from mistakes, iterate processes and continuously improve. We are looking for positive people to add to our team, that believe it isn’t success that leads to happiness, it’s happiness that leads to success. \nCompensation: $50,000-$55,000 base salary + $30,000 variable\n\nWorking at Take Command\n\nWe’re excited to build a team and culture that reflects our values! We offer competitive pay and health benefits to share with this position. Benefits do not apply to 1099 contract positions\n\nA generously funded ICHRA for medical, dental, and vision premiums and medical expenses.

The kitchen is well-stocked and we've designed the space to have lots of different areas to work--lounge on the couch, stand near your colleague at a kiosk desk or hole up in one of our phone rooms!Paid parental leave for new parentsFlexible on where you work – we hope to see you around the office on average 3 days a week especially when white-boarding or building relationships with your colleagues, but you also have the ability to work from home or wherever you'd like when you need to get focus work done.\n\nMore About Us\n\nWe secured our Series B funding in 2023 and are thrilled to be able to expand our team. Despite being a small startup in a land of health insurance giants, we’re the recognized industry leader for what we do (health insurance reimbursements) and passionate about bringing it to market because we know we can help fix a broken system and improve our clients’ wellbeing and health outcomes.\n\nWe’ve been featured in The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , The Dallas Morning News , and other national healthcare publications and are excited about our growth opportunities.\n\nTake Command knows diversity and inclusion among our teammates is integral to our company’s success and growth. Our vision is to recruit, develop, and retain the best team from a diverse candidate pool.\n\nThis has mostly been about us, but we’d love to hear from you--we can’t wait to hear your story!\n\nTake Command is an equal opportunity employer!
