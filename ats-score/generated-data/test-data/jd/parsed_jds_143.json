For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection, and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations, and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPurpose Of Activity\/Assignment\n\nUNICEF is seeking an expert consultant to develop a Toolkit for investors on Children’s Rights in Stewardship activities, and to revise the 2021 Tool for Investors on Integrating Children’s Rights into ESG Assessments.\n\nBackground\n\nInvestors can have major influence on investee companies in terms of responsible business practices, and social issues and human rights are clearly emerging as issues of concern for many investors. However, children’s rights risks typically aren’t systematically featured in this process. Children tend to be indirectly affected by company policies, either through their parents’ working conditions, through products consumed by them or through impacts on communities affecting them. Efforts of business aimed at improving social responsibility thus tend to partially leave children out, resulting in less effective risk mitigation and social impact on children.\n\nTo support investors to better integrate children’s rights in their ESG processes, UNICEF launched the Tool for Investors on integrating Children’s Rights into ESG assessments (2021), building on previously issued guidance for investors. The tool sets out a framework for assessing how well companies identify and manage impacts on children as part of their approaches to human rights due diligence and corporate responsibility. In UNICEF’s engagements with investors since the launch of this Tool, UNICEF has identified the need to complement this guidance with additional tools to support investors to utilize stewardship and active ownership strategies to manage risk and improve child rights outcomes in portfolio companies.\n\nScope Of Work\n\nUnder the guidance of the supervisor of this contract, the consultant will be responsible for:\n\nDevelopment of a Toolkit for Investors on Children’s Rights and Stewardship: UNICEF is looking to develop a set of guidance for investors to help them undertake stewardship activities to further respect for children's rights in portfolio companies, including the framing of expectations, direct engagement, and other stewardship activities. The toolkit should be practical, include sections describing how to identify priorities, how to plan a successful stewardship strategy, and highlight examples of specific child rights issues.Facilitation of consultations to validate toolkit: The consultant will facilitate a consultation with asset owners, asset managers, industry bodies, among others, to inform and validate the toolkit. The set of actors to be consulted will be suggested and agreed with UNICEF and the consultant, striving to cover both key markets and a diverse geographical array of public equity actors.Support on the publication and dissemination of the stewardship toolkit: including, but not limited to, ad hoc support on the publication process, final sign-in of consulted actors to be referenced and at least one internal (UNICEF-wide) and external event to launch the toolkit.Revision of UNICEF's Tool for Investors on integrating children’s rights into ESG assessments (2021), and updating this based on experiences of users\n\nTerms Of Reference \/ Key Deliverables\n\nProposal for a structure of the toolkit is developed based on the needs of intended users. – By 30.5.2024First draft of the toolkit for internal review is prepared based on an agreed toolkit structure. – By 30.7.2024Consultation exercise with key stakeholders in the finance sector to validate and collect additional feedback on the draft is facilitated a final draft is prepared integrating comments. – By 30.8.2024Publication of the toolkit is prepared.
