The brain and other organs communicate by secreting thousands of proteins that travel throughout the body and activate receptors on target cells, forming a biological communication network. While some secreted proteins, such as leptin, have been deeply studied, the majority remain poorly characterized because existing tools are inadequate to study the entire secretome. For this project, we will use newly developed technology to better understand how distal tissues communicate with the brain and to better deliver synthetic proteins for research and therapeutic applications.\n\nWe are looking to hire a curious, motivated, highly organized research assistant seeking experience in cutting-edge technology development and eager to make discoveries with molecular and synthetic biology techniques. During this project, you will gain experience in pooled screening techniques including library cloning, CRISPR screening, protein purification, proteomics and sequencing. We will use Python and Bash scripting to analyze and visualize large-scale biological datasets. You will be directly mentored by a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Josh Tycko, providing exposure and advice for the research career track.
