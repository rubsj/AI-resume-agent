We combine modern DNA sequencing and machine learning technology with breakthrough research on the forest microbiome to put the right native, biodiverse communities of mycorrhizal fungi in the right place. This leads to more quality wood created more quickly, more carbon sequestered, and more resilient forests. We serve land partners seeking to implement regenerative forestry practices that improve productivity and sustainability, and corporate carbon buyers building high-quality carbon removal portfolios with strong social and biodiversity outcomes. We're a team of passionate scientists and builders on a mission to draw down at least three gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2050.\nIf you are excited by starting new things, learning as you go, and being hands-on in applying your work to the private sector, you will dig working with us. We encourage you to apply even if only some of the below criteria are met - just make sure to tell us why you’re excited about Funga!\nAbout the RoleYears of research and in-field trials have gone into developing this powerful technology for improving the health and performance of forestry projects, which are vital to addressing many of our current crises. We are in the middle of a climate crisis, and Funga can pull down tens-of-millions of tons of additional CO2e every year. We are in a global shortage of timber and building materials, and Funga can accelerate the delivery of board-feet in a way that improves managed forest ecologies, rather than destroys them. The current biodiversity crisis has roots underground where sub-soil ecologies have been destroyed and homogenized.\nFunga aims to catalog and restore foundational soil biodiversity. Global businesses and governments need high-quality carbon removal solutions to enable emissions reduction and attainment of net zero goals. Funga is building a new class of sustainable, high-quality carbon removal with the potential to achieve enormous scale in the next five to ten years.\nDelivering on this potential requires translating complex science and technology into meaningful business outcomes. We are looking for an experienced Head of Product with a track record of creating compelling and differentiated product narratives through design and execution.\nThis role will report to the Chief Growth Officer, and is a highly cross-functional role that requires close collaboration with company leadership as well as the Science, Operations and Marketing functions. The role will be responsible for developing the Product Management function at Funga in service of increasing our success within our existing carbon product and new product offerings.
