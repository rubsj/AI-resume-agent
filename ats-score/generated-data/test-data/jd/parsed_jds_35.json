Our advisory team specializes in advisory services related to all forms of intangible assets, including brands, software, patent portfolios and supporting technology. In connection with these assets, we provide sell-side, buy-side, advisory and valuation services.\n\nWe are seeking an analyst to assist in sell-side, buy-side and advisory services. The person filling this role would supplement the efforts of and collaborate closely with our current analyst, to assist in managing an increasingly larger workflow.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nBy way of example: when a retailer files for bankruptcy and announces it is going out of business, the company sells the assets in the stores (apparel, furniture, etc.). The retailer’s brand name, e-commerce platform, domain names and other intangible assets have value and can also be sold.\n\nHilco Streambank serves as an agent that sells those intangible assets, whether because a company is going out of business or whether it simply seeks to divest itself of non-core assets. We develop processes to market these intangible assets, similar to the way in which investment banks run processes to market entire companies, but often on a much more compressed time frame and involving creatively implemented auction structures. We have conducted processes to sell assets including patents protecting technology related to augmented reality glasses, historic photography archives, department store nameplates and other retail brands and digital media publisher assets.\n\nWhen we are not engaged as the agent to market the intangible assets for sale, we often advise lenders with interests in those assets.\n\nSeparate from our sell-side advisory roles, we also assist clients in evaluating patent portfolios and provide advisory services related to patents including identifying white space (research and development opportunities), acquiring patents and other intangible assets, and identifying monetizable patents.\n\nWhat You Would Do\n\nThe analyst will support the team with all activities related to our advisory services, such as identifying potential targets who may have an interest in the particular assets we are marketing, drafting content for marketing collateral including teasers and brand books, working with clients to assemble diligence materials, conducting outreach efforts, drafting client-facing reports, participating in auctions and assisting in transaction closings. The candidate should be able to work on multiple projects and transactions at a given time.\n\nThe analyst will have the opportunity to interface with clients and potential buyers of a client’s assets, so good interpersonal skills are a must.\n\nThere is also an exciting opportunity to be on the precipice of adopting new tools including those utilizing artificial intelligence. We are an entrepreneurial team that moves quickly and looks forward to a candidate who can identify new ways to be creative and work collaboratively to create efficiencies in what we do.\n\nQualifications\n\n\nDetail orientedFinancial fluencyExceptional writing, proofreading, and communication skills (written and oral)Fluency in ExcelSelf-starter: ability to work in an entrepreneurial environment; can-do attitudeProactive team player who likes to work collaborativelyProblem solving abilities and excellent judgmentStrong organizational skills with ability to multi-task and prioritize deliverablesDriven to succeedRecent college graduate; Bachelor’s degree required; outstanding academic performance; degree in marketing, business or finance a plus\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nSalary Range: $70K - $80K, plus discretionary bonusBenefits, health insurance, 401(k), etc. on day one\n\n\nHilco Global is an equal opportunity employer.
