This will require a firm understanding of UX and user behavior. Having experience with performing usability testing (remote or in-person testing) will be a plus (but is not a strict requirement).Finding attention to detail exciting – in each audit, we analyze the client site across 700 UX parameters; each of these 700 parameters then has 4-7 defined implementation nuances the audit must account for. This requires an extreme level of attention to detail and excitement for exploring the smallest of UI nuances of a site. Explain UX in Writing: the primary deliverable for you to build an audit report. As the audit report relies on the foundation of vast catalog of UX research findings. You as an Auditor have to be good at accurately describing complex flows and user behaviors in writing. The audit reports are often read by a team with diverse backgrounds (managers, UXers, designers, and developers) – they all need to understand the described UX issue in just 4 paragraphs of text.Great Presentation Skills: – while audits are never presented in person at the client offices (due to global clients and somewhat short projects), the audit report deliverable is always followed up with a 2-hour conference call where you will be sharing your screen, walking the client through the audit report and key findings.
