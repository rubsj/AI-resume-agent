Throughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different geometries inside a wind tunnel.  Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.  This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.  It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.  Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.  Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.

Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper. We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.    "}
